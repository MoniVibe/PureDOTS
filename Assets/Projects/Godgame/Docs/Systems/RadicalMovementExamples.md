# Radical Movement Examples

Detailed scenarios of radical cells across different ideologies and contexts.

## Example 1: The Red Fist (Economic Radicals)

### Background
```
Village: Ironforge (mining town)
Population: 450
Economy: Mining + smithing
Governance: Merchant oligarchy (5 wealthy families control everything)
```

### Grievances
```
Wealth Distribution:
  - Top 5 families: 80% of wealth
  - Miners: 15% of wealth
  - Others: 5% of wealth

Conditions:
  - Miners work 14 hours/day
  - Wages: 2 gold/week (barely enough for food)
  - Mine accidents common (no safety measures)
  - Nobles live in luxury while workers starve
```

### Radicalization Process
```
Year 1:
  → Mine collapse kills 8 workers
  → Families receive no compensation
  → Grievance events:
      - FamilyHarm: +25 for each family
      - Injustice: +15 (no trial for mine owner)
      - Exploitation: +1.0/day (ongoing)
      - Inequality: +1.5/day (visible wealth gap)

Month 3:
  → Marcus (miner, lost brother in collapse):
      GrievanceLevel: 78/100
      RadicalizationThreshold: 50 (rebellious personality)
      Stage: Radicalized
      PrimaryGrievance: FamilyHarm + Exploitation

  → Forms cell "The Red Fist"
      Type: Rioters + Saboteurs
      Ideology: AntiCapitalist + WorkersRights + Egalitarian
      Members: 3 initial (Marcus + 2 friends)
```

### Cell Evolution

**Month 4-6: Recruitment Phase**
```
Activities:
  - Secret meetings in abandoned mine shaft
  - Propaganda: "The nobles grow fat while we die in darkness"
  - Recruit grievance-heavy miners
  - Target: Workers with family losses or injuries

Growth:
  → 3 members → 18 members
  → Secrecy: 75 (meeting in hidden location)
  → Public Support: 35% (many sympathize, few join)
```

**Month 7: First Operation - Strike**
```
Operation:
  Type: Strike
  Participants: All 18 members
  Plan: Refuse to work until safety improvements made
  DetectionRisk: 0% (legal action)
  ExpectedImpact: 40

Outcome:
  → Mine production stops
  → Nobles threaten to fire strikers
  → Marcus negotiates: "Safety or we leave permanently"
  → Nobles refuse (greedy)
  → Strike continues 2 weeks
  → Village loses 5,000 gold in production
```

**Month 8: Escalation - Sabotage**
```
Operation:
  Type: Sabotage
  Target: Noble's warehouse (food supplies)
  Participants: 6 members (core radicals)
  Plan: Burn warehouse to hurt noble economically
  DetectionRisk: 40%
  ExpectedImpact: 60
  WasViolent: false (no casualties)

Outcome:
  → Warehouse burns
  → 10,000 gold in losses
  → Noble family furious
  → Village Response: Suppression policy activated
  → Guards begin arrests
```

**Month 9: Suppression**
```
Village Response:
  Policy: Suppression
  Action: Mass arrests of suspected radicals

Arrests:
  → 12 members arrested (Marcus escapes)
  → 3 executed as ringleaders
  → 9 exiled to wilderness

Martyrdom Effect:
  → Executed members become legendary
  → +20 grievance to all remaining miners
  → Public Support: 35% → 55%
  → 22 new radicals created
  → 2 new cells formed ("Red Banner", "Liberation Front")
```

**Month 10-12: Underground Resistance**
```
Marcus (in hiding):
  → Commitment: 100 (willing to die)
  → Stage: Extremist
  → Plans: Assassination of noble who ordered executions

New Cell Formation:
  "Red Fist (Reborn)": 15 members
  Type: Revolutionaries + Terrorists
  Ideology: Revolutionary + AntiElite
  Secrecy: 90 (totally underground)
  AggressionLevel: 85 (very violent)

Operations:
  1. Assassination attempt on noble (failed, 2 radicals killed)
  2. Ambush on guards (3 guards killed)
  3. Arson on noble mansion (success, noble family flees)

Village Impact:
  → StabilityLoss: 45%
  → EconomicDamage: 35,000 gold
  → AuthorityDeaths: 3
  → ActiveCells: 3
  → Village descending into civil war
```

**Resolution Options**:

1. **Crackdown**: Martial law, hunt down all radicals
   - Result: Village becomes police state, oppression permanent

2. **Reform**: New leadership, improve mine safety, fair wages
   - Result: Moderates de-radicalize, extremists remain

3. **Negotiation**: Offer worker representation council
   - Result: Partial success, some cells disband

## Example 3: The Liberation Collective (Anarchist Radicals)

### Background
```
Village: Westmark (agricultural)
Population: 600
Governance: Noble lord (hereditary)
Issue: Lord is incompetent and cruel
```

### Grievances
```
Lord's Failures:
  - Embezzled food during famine (+10 Corruption)
  - Executed critics without trial (+15 Injustice)
  - Raised taxes to 60% (+2.0 Taxation/day)
  - Lavish parties while people starve (+3.0 Hunger/day)

Name: "The Liberation Collective"
Type: Revolutionaries + Anarchists
Ideology: Anarchist + Democratic + AntiMonarchy + AntiElite
Members: 147 (25% of population!)
Secrecy: 40 (too large to hide effectively)
PublicSupport: 70% (overwhelming sympathy)
```

### Strategy
```
Goal: Overthrow lord, establish direct democracy

Phase 1: Delegitimization
  → Spread propaganda
  → Reveal lord's crimes
  → Parallel governance (cell provides services lord won't)

Phase 2: Mass Mobilization
  → General strike
  → Mass demonstrations
  → Civil disobedience

Phase 3: Confrontation
  → Occupy lord's manor
  → Demand abdication
  → Prepare for violence if needed
```

### Timeline

**Month 1-2: Propaganda Campaign**
```
Operations:
  - Pamphlets detailing lord's crimes
  - Secret meetings explaining anarchist principles
  - Build parallel food distribution network

Effect:
  → Public Support: 70% → 85%
  → Lord loses legitimacy
  → Cell grows: 147 → 203 members
```

**Month 3: General Strike**
```
Operation:
  Type: Strike
  Participants: 350 (most village)
  Plan: Stop all work until lord abdicates
  ExpectedImpact: 90

Outcome:
  → Village economy stops completely
  → No food production, no taxes collected
  → Lord sends guards to force people to work
  → Guards refuse (sympathize with strikers)
  → Lord isolated in manor
```

**Month 4: Occupation**
```
Operation:
  Type: Occupation
  Target: Lord's manor
  Participants: 500 (85% of village)
  Plan: Surround manor, demand abdication
  WasViolent: false (initially)

Outcome:
  → Manor surrounded
  → Lord barricaded inside with 10 loyal guards
  → Standoff begins
  → King sends messenger to investigate
```

**Month 5: Resolution**

**Option A: Violent Crackdown**
```
King sends army:
  → 200 soldiers arrive
  → Massacre: 87 villagers killed
  → Cell leaders executed publicly
  → Village crushed
  → Result: Oppression intensifies, new cells form across region
```

**Option B: Negotiated Settlement**
```
King's investigation finds:
  → Lord is indeed corrupt and cruel
  → Villagers have legitimate grievances
  → Unrest spreading to other villages

King's Decision:
  → Remove corrupt lord
  → Install new, fair lord
  → Reduce taxes to 35%
  → Amnesty for radicals (if they disband)

Cell Response:
  → Moderates accept (goal partially achieved)
  → Anarchists reject (wanted NO lord)
  → Cell splits:
      - 170 members accept, de-radicalize
      - 33 hardcore anarchists remain
```

**Option C: Revolutionary Success**
```
Lord flees in night:
  → Village declares independence
  → Establishes village council (direct democracy)
  → Cell becomes government
  → Result: Anarchist experiment begins
  → King may send army later OR tolerate if stable
```

```

**Response**:
```
Village Response:
  Policy: Crackdown
  Actions:
    - Hunt down cell members
    - Arrest Aldric (executed)
    - Disband cell by force

Outcome:
  → Cell destroyed
  → 12 members killed, 33 arrested

## Summary Table

| Cell Name | Ideology | Primary Grievance | Violence Level | Public Support | Outcome |
|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| **Red Fist** | Economic | Exploitation + Inequality | High | 55% | Ongoing conflict |
| **Children of Veil** | Religious | Persecution | Medium | 45% | Negotiated resolution |
| **Liberation Collective** | Anarchist | Corruption + Authoritarianism | Low initially | 85% | Variable (3 paths) |
| **Purity Front** | Supremacist | Economic (false blame) | Very High | 20% | Destroyed by force |

## Key Patterns

### Legitimate vs Illegitimate Radicalization

**Legitimate Grievances** (can be addressed):
- Economic oppression (Red Fist)
- Religious persecution (Children of Veil)
- Political corruption (Liberation Collective)

**Illegitimate Radicalization** (pure destruction):
- Scapegoating minorities (Purity Front)
- Nihilistic violence
- Apocalyptic cults

### Effective Responses

| Cell Type | Best Response | Why |
|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Economic | Reform + Negotiation | Address material conditions |
| Religious | Tolerance + Negotiation | Allow faith, compromise |
| Political | Reform + Selective Suppression | Fix system, remove violent |
| Supremacist | Immediate Crackdown | Protect victims, no negotiation |

### Radicalization Cycle

```
Grievance Accumulation
  ↓
Individual Radicalization
  ↓
Cell Formation
  ↓
Minor Operations (testing)
  ↓
Escalation (violence)
  ↓
Government Response
  ↓
Martyrdom Effect OR De-radicalization
  ↓
New Cycle or Resolution
```

**Breaking the Cycle**:
- Address grievances early (before radicalization)
- Targeted responses (suppress violent, negotiate with moderate)
- Avoid creating martyrs
- Reform systems to prevent recurrence
