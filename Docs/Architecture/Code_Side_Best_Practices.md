## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Coding best practices for PureDOTS:
- Component design patterns (when to use IComponentData vs IBufferElementData)
- System ordering guidelines (dependency chains)
- Blob asset patterns (when/how to use blob assets)
- Entity archetype optimization (minimize component combinations)
- Naming conventions
- Code organization patterns

---

## Key Questions

- When to use IComponentData vs IBufferElementData?
- How to order systems (dependency management)?
- When to use blob assets?
- How to optimize entity archetypes?
- What are naming conventions?
- How to organize code?

---

## Integration Points

- **All Systems**: All code follows best practices
- **Component Design**: Component patterns
- **System Design**: System patterns
- **Performance**: Best practices affect performance

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Component design guidelines (when to use what)
- [ ] System ordering rules (dependency guidelines)
- [ ] Blob asset usage patterns (when/how to use)
- [ ] Archetype optimization strategies (how to minimize combinations)
- [ ] Naming conventions (consistent naming)
- [ ] Code organization (file/folder structure)
