# Debugging and Visualization System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Architecture / Tools / Debugging  
**Related Systems**: AI Telemetry System, All Systems

---

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Debugging and visualization tools:
- Visual debugging tools (show relations, communication attempts)
- State inspection (what is entity thinking right now?)
- Event replay (step through what happened)
- Performance profiling integration
- Debug overlays and visualizations

---

## Key Questions

- How to visualize entity state (relations, goals, etc.)?
- How to inspect what entities are thinking?
- How to replay events for debugging?
- How to integrate performance profiling?
- What debug overlays are needed?
- How to visualize system interactions?

---

## Integration Points

- **AI Telemetry System**: Existing telemetry infrastructure
- **All Systems**: All systems need debugging support
- **Relations System**: Visualize relation networks
- **Communication System**: Visualize communication attempts
- **Decision-Making**: Visualize decision processes
- **Performance**: Profiling integration

---

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Visualization tools (what tools to build)
- [ ] State inspection format (how to display state)
- [ ] Event replay mechanics (how replay works)
- [ ] Profiling integration (Unity Profiler, custom?)
- [ ] Debug overlay design (what to show)
- [ ] Debug UI framework (how to build debug UI)
