# Modding Architecture

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Architecture / Modding / Extensibility  
**Related Systems**: Sandbox Mode, All Systems

---

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Modding support architecture:
- Plugin system architecture
- Data injection points (where mods can add content)
- API surface (what mods can access)
- Version compatibility (mods work across game versions?)
- Mod loading and management

---

## Key Questions

- How do mods integrate with the game?
- What can mods modify (data, systems, content)?
- What API do mods have access to?
- How do mods work across game versions?
- How are mods loaded and managed?
- What are modding best practices?

---

## Integration Points

- **Sandbox Mode**: Modding support
- **All Systems**: Systems need modding hooks
- **Data Systems**: Data needs modding support
- **Content Systems**: Content needs modding support

---

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Plugin architecture (how mods integrate)
- [ ] Data injection points (where mods can inject)
- [ ] API surface definition (what mods can access)
- [ ] Version compatibility strategy (how mods work across versions)
- [ ] Mod loading system (how mods are loaded)
- [ ] Modding best practices (guidelines for modders)
