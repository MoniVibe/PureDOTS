# Multi-Threading and Job Scheduling

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Architecture / Performance / Best Practices  
**Related Systems**: All Systems

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Burst job scheduling and multi-threading:
- Burst job scheduling strategies
- Dependency management (system A must run before B)
- Parallel processing patterns (what can run simultaneously)
- Thread safety patterns (shared data access)
- Job system optimization

---

## Key Questions

- How to schedule Burst jobs efficiently?
- How to manage system dependencies?
- What can run in parallel?
- How to ensure thread safety?
- How to optimize job scheduling?
- What are job scheduling best practices?

---

## Integration Points

- **All Systems**: All systems use job scheduling
- **System Ordering**: Dependency chains
- **Performance**: Job scheduling affects performance
- **Burst Compilation**: Burst compatibility requirements

---

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Job scheduling strategy (how jobs are scheduled)
- [ ] Dependency management (how dependencies are handled)
- [ ] Parallel processing patterns (what can be parallelized)
- [ ] Thread safety patterns (how to ensure safety)
- [ ] Job system optimization (how to optimize scheduling)
- [ ] Best practices documentation (guidelines)
