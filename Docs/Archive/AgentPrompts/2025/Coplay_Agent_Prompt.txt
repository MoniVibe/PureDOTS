TASK: Fix SubScene link and verify GameObjects are being baked into DOTS entities

CURRENT SITUATION - CRITICAL ISSUE:
- ✅ SubScene component IS linked to GameEntities.unity (fixed in file)
- ❌ GameEntities.unity file is EMPTY - contains NO GameObjects
- ❌ GameObjects are still in main scene (SpawnerDemoScene.unity), NOT in subscene file
- ❌ Console shows: "GameObjects aren't in a subscene (must be in subscene for DOTS baking)"
- ❌ PROBLEM: Zero entities created - Vessels=0, Villagers=0, Resources=0, Carriers=0

ROOT CAUSE:
Unity SubScenes require GameObjects to be INSIDE the subscene file (.unity), not just parented to a GameObject with a SubScene component. Parented GameObjects stay in the main scene and won't be baked.

REQUIRED ACTION - CRITICAL (GAMEOBJECTS MUST BE IN SUBSCENE FILE):

OPTION 1: Use Unity Editor "Create SubScene from Selection" (RECOMMENDED):
1. In Unity Editor, select ALL GameObjects that need to be baked:
   - Carrier (and its children MiningVessel1, MiningVessel2)
   - ResourceNode_Wood1, ResourceNode_Wood2, ResourceNode_Wood3
   - OreNode1, OreNode2
   - Asteroid_Ore1, Asteroid_Ore2, Asteroid_Ore3
   - Storehouse
   - Villager GameObjects (if they exist in scene)
2. Right-click selected GameObjects → "New Sub Scene" → "From Selection"
3. Unity will create a new subscene and AUTOMATICALLY move GameObjects into it
4. Delete old GameEntities_SubScene GameObject if it exists
5. The new subscene GameObject will have SubScene component automatically linked

OPTION 2: Manually Move GameObjects to Existing SubScene:
1. Open GameEntities.unity subscene file (double-click in Project window)
2. Drag GameObjects from main scene Hierarchy into the subscene Hierarchy
3. Save the subscene file
4. Close subscene, return to main scene
5. Verify SubScene component on GameEntities_SubScene is linked

OPTION 3: Use Unity MCP (if available):
- Use manage_prefabs or manage_scene to move GameObjects
- Or find GameObjects, get their paths, copy to subscene file manually

VERIFY VILLAGERSPAWNER:
- Find "VillagerSpawner" GameObject
- Check VillagerSpawnerAuthoring component
- villagerPrefab field should reference a Villager prefab (currently {fileID: 0})
- If missing, assign Assets/PureDOTS/Prefabs/Villager.prefab or similar

4. Enter Play Mode and verify entities are created:
   - Check console for "Vessels: Total=2" (should be >0)
   - Check console for "Villagers: Total=2" (should be >0) 
   - Check console for "ResourceRegistry: Entries=8" (should be >0)
   - If still 0, check Entities window (Window > Entities > Hierarchy) to see if entities exist

WHY GAMEOBJECTS MUST BE IN SUBSCENE FILE:
- Unity ONLY bakes GameObjects that are INSIDE a subscene file (.unity)
- Parented GameObjects stay in main scene - they WON'T be baked
- GameObjects must be MOVED INTO the subscene file, not just parented
- SubScene component link alone isn't enough - GameObjects must physically be in subscene file
- Systems query for DOTS components (VesselMovement, VillagerMovement, etc.) find ZERO entities
- Result: Nothing moves because nothing exists in the ECS world

HOW UNITY SUBSCENES WORK:
- When SubScene is OPEN: Unity displays GameObjects, performs live baking
- When SubScene is CLOSED: Unity streams in baked entities
- GameObjects MUST be in the subscene file itself for baking to occur

IF SUBSCENE LINK KEEPS REVERTING:
- Unity may reset it if the subscene file structure is invalid
- Verify GameEntities.unity is a valid scene file (has proper YAML header)
- Open the subscene in Unity Editor at least once to trigger proper setup
- Check that GameEntities.unity.meta file exists with correct GUID

SUCCESS CRITERIA (ALL MUST BE TRUE):
- ✅ SubScene component's _SceneAsset references GameEntities.unity (already fixed)
- ✅ SubScene component's _SceneGUID matches scene file GUID (already fixed)
- ❌ CRITICAL: GameEntities.unity file MUST contain GameObjects (currently EMPTY)
- ❌ CRITICAL: Verify GameObjects are INSIDE subscene file, not just parented
- VillagerSpawnerAuthoring has villagerPrefab assigned (check separately)
- Entering Play Mode creates DOTS entities
- Console shows: Vessels: Total>0, Villagers: Total>0, ResourceRegistry: Entries>0
- No "[MovementDiagnostic] NO VESSEL ENTITIES FOUND!" errors
- Entities window (Window > Entities > Hierarchy) shows entities exist

HOW TO VERIFY GAMEOBJECTS ARE IN SUBSCENE:
- Read Assets/Scenes/GameEntities.unity file
- Search for "GameObject:" entries (should find Carrier, MiningVessel, ResourceNode, etc.)
- If file only has OcclusionCullingSettings, RenderSettings, LightmapSettings - it's EMPTY
- GameObjects MUST be in subscene file for baking to work

USE MCP TOOLS:
- manage_gameobject to find/select GameEntities_SubScene
- manage_scene to verify scene state
- read_console to check entity creation logs
- Direct file editing if needed for manual migration
