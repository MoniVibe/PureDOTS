TASK: Fix "Display 1 No Camera Rendering" - Configure Main Camera Component

CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Main Camera GameObject EXISTS in main scene (created via menu)
- ✅ Position: (0, 15, -20), Rotation: (60, 0, 0)
- ✅ Tag: "MainCamera"
- ❌ Camera component may not be configured correctly (needs enabled=true, depth=0)

REQUIRED ACTION:
1. VERIFY Main Camera is in MAIN SCENE (not subscene):
   - Use manage_gameobject find by_name "Main Camera"
   - Verify scenePath is "Assets/Scenes/SpawnerDemoScene.unity/SpawnerDemoScene.unity" (NOT subscene)
   - If in subscene, move to main scene

2. CONFIGURE Camera component (CRITICAL):
   - Use manage_gameobject get_components "Main Camera" to check Camera component
   - Use manage_gameobject set_component_property to set:
     * enabled: true (MUST be true)
     * depth: 0 (MUST be 0 for main camera)
     * clearFlags: 1 (SolidColor)
     * backgroundColor: {"r": 0.3, "g": 0.5, "b": 0.7, "a": 1}
     * fieldOfView: 60
     * nearClipPlane: 0.3
     * farClipPlane: 1000
   
   IMPORTANT: Use valid JSON format:
   {"enabled": true, "depth": 0, "clearFlags": 1, "backgroundColor": {"r": 0.3, "g": 0.5, "b": 0.7, "a": 1}, "fieldOfView": 60, "nearClipPlane": 0.3, "farClipPlane": 1000}

3. CHECK FOR SUBSCENE CAMERA (if exists):
   - Open subscene "New Sub Scene.unity"
   - Delete the Main Camera GameObject from subscene
   - OR disable its Camera component

4. VERIFY Rendering:
   - Enter Play Mode
   - Game View should show rendered scene (not black/gray)
   - Console should show: "[Space4XCameraRenderSyncSystem] Found/Created Main Camera"

MCP TOOLS TO USE:
- manage_gameobject create (with position, rotation, tag)
- manage_gameobject add_component (Camera component)
- manage_gameobject set_component_property (configure Camera settings)
- manage_scene get_hierarchy (verify Main Camera is in main scene)

IF MCP CAN'T CREATE IN MAIN SCENE:
- Use Unity Editor:
  1. Select root of Hierarchy (main scene level)
  2. Right-click → Camera
  3. Rename to "Main Camera"
  4. Set Tag to "MainCamera"
  5. Position: (0, 15, -20), Rotation: (60, 0, 0)
  6. In Camera component: Depth=0, Enabled=true

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ Main Camera GameObject exists in MAIN SCENE (not subscene)
- ✅ Camera component enabled=true, depth=0
- ✅ Game View shows rendered scene in Play Mode
- ✅ Console shows camera found/syncing messages
- ✅ No "Display 1 no camera rendering" message

WHY THIS IS CRITICAL:
Unity SubScenes are for baking GameObjects into DOTS entities. Cameras should remain in the main scene to render the view. A camera in a subscene won't render in the main scene view, causing "no camera rendering" errors.
