TASK: Diagnose why Main Camera isn't rendering despite correct configuration

CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Main Camera GameObject EXISTS in main scene
- ✅ Camera component: enabled=true, depth=0, clearFlags=1
- ✅ Position: (0, 15, -20), Rotation: (60, 0, 0)
- ✅ Tag: "MainCamera"
- ❌ Game View shows "Display 1 no camera rendering"

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS NEEDED:

1. CHECK CONSOLE ERRORS:
   - Use read_console get (all types: error, warning, log)
   - Look for:
     * Camera rendering errors
     * Render pipeline errors
     * URP/Graphics settings errors
     * "No cameras rendering" messages
     * Camera component errors

2. VERIFY RENDER PIPELINE SETUP:
   - Check Edit > Project Settings > Graphics
   - Verify Render Pipeline Asset is assigned
   - If using URP, ensure URP Asset exists and is assigned
   - Check if default render pipeline is set

3. CHECK CAMERA STATE IN PLAY MODE:
   - Enter Play Mode
   - Check if Space4XCameraRenderSyncSystem is running
   - Console should show: "[Space4XCameraRenderSyncSystem] Found/Created Main Camera"
   - Check if camera state singleton exists

4. VERIFY CAMERA IS NOT DISABLED:
   - Use manage_gameobject get_component "Main Camera" "Camera"
   - Verify enabled=true
   - Check if GameObject.activeSelf=true
   - Check if GameObject.activeInHierarchy=true

5. CHECK FOR CONFLICTING CAMERAS:
   - Use manage_gameobject find by_component "Camera"
   - List all cameras in scene
   - Ensure only Main Camera has depth=0
   - Other cameras should have depth>0 or be disabled

6. CHECK RENDER SETTINGS:
   - Use manage_scene get_active
   - Verify scene is correctly loaded
   - Check if Game View is actually showing the scene (not a different scene)

7. VERIFY CAMERA SYSTEMS ARE RUNNING:
   - Check console for:
     * "[Space4XCameraInitializationSystem]" - Should have created camera state
     * "[Space4XCameraRenderSyncSystem]" - Should sync camera transform
     * "[Space4XCameraSystem]" - Should process camera input
   - If systems aren't logging, they may not be running

COMMON ISSUES:

A. Render Pipeline Not Assigned:
   - Symptoms: Black screen, no rendering
   - Fix: Assign URP Asset to Graphics Settings

B. Camera Component Disabled:
   - Symptoms: "No cameras rendering"
   - Fix: Enable Camera component, verify GameObject is active

C. Camera Outside View/Too Far:
   - Symptoms: Game View is solid color (background color)
   - Fix: Verify camera position is correct, check if scene has objects to render

D. Multiple Cameras Conflicting:
   - Symptoms: Wrong camera rendering or no rendering
   - Fix: Ensure only Main Camera has depth=0, disable/remove others

E. Camera Systems Not Running:
   - Symptoms: Camera doesn't respond to input, state not updating
   - Fix: Check if DOTS systems are enabled, verify world is initialized

F. Scene Not Properly Loaded:
   - Symptoms: Empty scene, no GameObjects visible
   - Fix: Verify correct scene is active, check if subscenes are loaded

MCP TOOLS TO USE:
- read_console get (types: ["error", "warning", "log"])
- manage_gameobject get_component "Main Camera" "Camera"
- manage_gameobject find by_component "Camera"
- manage_scene get_active
- manage_editor get_state (check if playing, compiling, etc.)

IF CAN'T FIX WITH MCP:
1. In Unity Editor:
   - Window > Analysis > Rendering Debugger (check render settings)
   - Edit > Project Settings > Graphics (verify render pipeline)
   - Window > Entities > Systems (check if camera systems are running)
   - Window > Entities > Hierarchy (check if camera state singleton exists)

2. Manual Camera Reset:
   - Delete Main Camera
   - Create new Camera
   - Configure: Tag="MainCamera", Depth=0, Enabled=true
   - Position: (0, 15, -20), Rotation: (60, 0, 0)

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ Console shows no camera/rendering errors
- ✅ Render Pipeline Asset is assigned in Graphics Settings
- ✅ Main Camera enabled=true, depth=0, in main scene
- ✅ Enter Play Mode → Game View shows rendered scene
- ✅ Console shows camera systems running
- ✅ Camera responds to WASD/mouse input
