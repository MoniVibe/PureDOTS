## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Environmental effects on simulation:
- Weather systems (rain, fog, storms)
- Seasonal cycles (affecting resources, behavior)
- Day/night cycles (beyond circadian - environmental effects)
- Terrain effects (on formations, movement, visibility)
- Climate zones (different environmental rules)

---

## Key Questions

- How does weather affect communication range/clarity?
- How do seasons affect resource availability?
- How does day/night affect visibility and behavior?
- How does terrain affect formation effectiveness?
- How do environmental conditions affect movement speed?
- How do entities adapt to environmental changes?

---

## Integration Points

- **Communication System**: Weather affects communication reliability
- **Movement System**: Terrain/weather affects movement
- **Combat System**: Environmental conditions affect combat
- **Formations System**: Terrain affects formation effectiveness
- **Resource System**: Seasons affect resource generation
- **Procedural World Generation**: Environment generation

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Weather representation (how to model weather?)
- [ ] Seasonal cycle mechanics (how seasons change)
- [ ] Day/night effects (beyond circadian rhythms)
- [ ] Terrain type system (what terrain types exist?)
- [ ] Environmental effect calculation (how effects are applied)
- [ ] Entity adaptation (how entities respond to environment)
