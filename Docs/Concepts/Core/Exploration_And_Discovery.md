# Exploration and Discovery System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / World / Knowledge  
**Related Systems**: Procedural World Generation, Communication System, Information Propagation, Memory System

---

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

How entities learn about the world:
- Exploration mechanics (how entities explore)
- Map knowledge (fog of war, discovered locations)
- Information sharing (how discoveries spread)
- Hidden knowledge (secrets, lost locations)
- Discovery rewards

---

## Key Questions

- How do entities explore (active exploration vs passive discovery)?
- How is map knowledge tracked (fog of war, discovered areas)?
- How do discoveries spread (information propagation)?
- How are secrets/hidden knowledge handled?
- What rewards come from discovery?
- How do entities decide where to explore?

---

## Integration Points

- **Procedural World Generation**: World to explore
- **Communication System**: Sharing discoveries
- **Information Propagation**: Discovery information spreads
- **Memory System**: Discoveries create memories
- **Relations System**: Sharing discoveries affects relations
- **Resource System**: Discoveries reveal resources

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Exploration mechanics (how exploration works)
- [ ] Map knowledge model (how knowledge is tracked)
- [ ] Discovery sharing (how discoveries spread)
- [ ] Hidden knowledge system (secrets, lost locations)
- [ ] Discovery rewards (what entities gain from discovery)
- [ ] Exploration decision-making (where to explore)
