# Information Propagation System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / Communication / Social  
**Related Systems**: Communication System, Miscommunication System, Relations System, Reputation System

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Information spreading through simulation:
- Rumor spreading (how fast, how accurate)
- News/intelligence networks
- Information decay (old news becomes less relevant)
- Information warfare (false rumors, propaganda)
- Information sources (who spreads what)

---

## Key Questions

- How fast do rumors spread?
- How does information accuracy degrade over distance/time?
- How do entities verify information (fact-checking)?
- How does false information spread vs true information?
- How do information networks form (who talks to whom)?
- How does information affect decision-making?

---

## Integration Points

- **Communication System**: Information spreads via communication
- **Miscommunication System**: False information from miscommunications
- **Relations System**: Trust affects information acceptance
- **Reputation System**: Information affects reputation
- **Decision-Making**: Information affects entity decisions
- **Forces System**: Intelligence networks in warfare

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Rumor spreading model (network topology, speed)
- [ ] Information accuracy tracking (how accurate is info?)
- [ ] Information decay mechanics (how info becomes outdated)
- [ ] False information mechanics (propaganda, lies)
- [ ] Information verification (can entities fact-check?)
- [ ] Information network structure (who spreads to whom)
