# Memory and History Integration System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / Knowledge / Social  
**Related Systems**: Memories System, Relations System, Miscommunication System, Communication System

---

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Integration between:
- Memories system (cultural/personal memories)
- Historical event tracking
- Relations system (how memories affect relations)
- Miscommunication system (how memories affect communication)
- Collective vs individual memory

---

## Key Questions

- How do major events (battles, disasters, miracles) create persistent memories?
- How do memories affect future decision-making?
- How do aggregates remember vs individuals?
- How does memory decay affect current relations?
- How do miscommunications create false memories?
- How do cultural memories spread vs personal memories?

---

## Integration Points

- **Memories System**: [Existing system - needs integration]
- **Relations System**: Memories affect relation values
- **Miscommunication System**: False memories from miscommunications
- **Communication System**: Teaching/sharing memories
- **Tactical Commands**: Historical battles inform formation choices
- **Reputation System**: Memories contribute to reputation

---

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Memory persistence model (how long do memories last?)
- [ ] Memory accuracy (do memories degrade over time?)
- [ ] False memory mechanics (can entities remember things wrong?)
- [ ] Collective memory aggregation (how do villages remember?)
- [ ] Memory conflict resolution (conflicting memories between entities)
- [ ] Memory preservation priority (which memories are preserved?)
