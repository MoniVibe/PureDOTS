# Resource Logistics and Transport System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / Economy / Logistics  
**Related Systems**: Inventory System, Trade System, Movement System, Forces System

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Resource movement and logistics:
- Transport systems (caravans, supply chains, cargo ships)
- Resource flow between locations
- Logistics planning (what to move where, when)
- Supply line mechanics (cutting off resources in combat)
- Transport capacity and efficiency

---

## Key Questions

- How do entities decide what resources to transport?
- How do supply chains work (A → B → C)?
- How do transport routes get established?
- What happens when supply lines are cut?
- How does transport capacity affect movement speed?
- How do entities plan logistics (optimization)?

---

## Integration Points

- **Inventory System**: Resources in inventories need transport
- **Trade System**: Trade requires transport
- **Movement System**: Transport affects movement speed
- **Forces System**: Military supply lines
- **Combat System**: Supply line disruption in warfare
- **Economy System**: Resource flow affects prices

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Transport entity representation (caravans, ships as entities?)
- [ ] Route planning (how routes are chosen)
- [ ] Supply line tracking (how to identify supply lines)
- [ ] Transport capacity model (mass/volume limits)
- [ ] Transport speed calculation (how capacity affects speed)
- [ ] Logistics optimization (should entities optimize routes?)
