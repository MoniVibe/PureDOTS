# Skill and Attribute Progression System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / Progression / Learning  
**Related Systems**: Learning Systems, Communication Experience, Formation Training, Combat System

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Entity skill and attribute growth:
- Skill trees and specialization paths
- Attribute growth (strength, intelligence over time)
- Mastery systems (expertise levels beyond proficiency)
- Skill decay (unused skills degrade?)
- Skill synergies (skills that work together)

---

## Key Questions

- How do skills improve over time?
- Are there skill trees or free-form progression?
- Do attributes grow with use or training?
- Do unused skills decay?
- How do skill synergies work?
- How do mastery levels work (beyond basic proficiency)?

---

## Integration Points

- **Learning Systems**: Skills improve through learning
- **Communication Experience**: Communication skills improve
- **Formation Training**: Combat skills improve
- **Combat System**: Skills affect combat effectiveness
- **Decision-Making**: Skills affect available actions
- **Relations System**: Skills affect social interactions

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Skill representation (how skills are stored)
- [ ] Skill improvement mechanics (how skills grow)
- [ ] Skill tree structure (if using trees)
- [ ] Attribute growth model (how attributes improve)
- [ ] Skill decay mechanics (if skills degrade)
- [ ] Mastery system design (expertise levels)
