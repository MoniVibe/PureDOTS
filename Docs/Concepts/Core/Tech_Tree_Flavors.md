## Purpose

This document defines **tech flavors** - the thematic and mechanical variations of technologies based on alignment, outlook, and behavior combinations. Tech flavors enable:

- **Cross-family techs:** Universal modifications that apply across multiple tech families
- **Divergent techs:** Branching paths where one tech splits into multiple specialized variants
- **Outlook-specific techs:** Unique technologies unlocked by specific alignment/outlook combinations
- **Convergent techs:** Multiple paths merging into advanced combined technologies

**Core Principle:** The same base technology (e.g., "Railgun") can manifest differently based on cultural values, creating distinct gameplay paths and strategic choices.

---

## Overview: Tech Flavors System

### What Are Tech Flavors?

**Tech flavors** are semantic modifiers that transform base technologies into culturally-appropriate variants. They emerge from:

1. **Alignment values** (Moral, Order, Purity)
2. **Outlook combinations** (Warlike, Spiritual, Materialist, etc.)
3. **Behavior profiles** (Might/Magic affinity, Vengeful/Forgiving, etc.)

**PureDOTS provides:**
- Base tech definitions (what the tech does mechanically)
- Flavor axis values (how it's expressed culturally)
- No hardcoded flavor names (games interpret)

**Games interpret:**
- Map flavor values to specific tech variants
- Create flavor names (e.g., "Sniper Railgun" vs "Rapid-Fire Railgun")
- Define flavor-specific mechanics and visuals

### Flavor Categories

**1. Cross-Family Flavors:**
- Universal modifications that apply to multiple tech families
- Example: "Rapid Fire" can apply to lasers, railguns, missiles, spells

**2. Divergent Flavors:**
- Base tech splits into specialized branches
- Example: Railgun → Sniper Railgun (long range, high damage) OR Rapid-Fire Railgun (high RoF, lower damage)

**3. Convergent Flavors:**
- Multiple techs merge into advanced combined tech
- Example: Laser + Missile → Laser-Guided Missiles

**4. Outlook-Specific Flavors:**
- Unique techs only available to specific outlook combinations
- Example: Xenophobic Warlike → "Purification Beams" (anti-alien weapons)

**5. Special Flavors:**
- Rare or unique techs with special requirements
- Example: Fanatic Spiritual + Pure → "Divine Weapons" (holy damage)

## Research Mechanics

### Research Organization Models

**Research can be organized in two ways, determined by aggregate profile:**

**1. Centralized Research (Lawful, Authoritarian aggregates):**
- Research decisions made by aggregate leadership or player
- Entities follow assigned research projects
- Coordinated research efforts, shared resources
- Specialization through designated research teams
- Example: Lawful Authoritarian village assigns scholars to specific projects

**2. Independent Research (Chaotic, Egalitarian aggregates):**
- Entities pursue their own research projects
- No central coordination, organic discovery
- Chaotic entities will pursue their own projects regardless of aggregate decisions
- Egalitarian entities may collaborate but maintain autonomy
- Example: Chaotic village scholars research whatever interests them

**3. Hybrid Models:**
- **Lawful Egalitarian:** Democratic research decisions, but entities follow collective choices
- **Chaotic Authoritarian:** Leaders assign projects, but chaotic entities may ignore assignments
- **Neutral:** Mix of centralized and independent based on context

### Research Specialization

**Entities can specialize in specific research fields:**

**Specialization Mechanics:**
- Researchers gain expertise in specific categories (weapons, magic, metallurgy, etc.)
- Specialization increases research speed and quality in that field
- Specialized researchers unlock better variants of techs in their field

**Institutional Specialization:**
- **Universities/Faculties:** Aggregate entities can build specialized research institutions
- **Field-Specific Facilities:** Dedicated buildings for specific research categories
- **Research Teams:** Groups of specialized researchers working together
- Example: "University of Arcane Studies" - specializes in magic research, unlocks better spell variants

**Specialization Benefits:**
- Faster research in specialized field

- Variant has better heat management, unique to that researcher's innovation

**Collaboration Benefits:**
- Multiple researchers working together can share inspiration
- Collaborative research can unlock better variants
- Cross-pollination of ideas creates unique techs

### Research Loss, Theft & Recovery

**Research can be lost, stolen, or recovered:**

**Research Loss:**

- Entity A (Intelligence 85, specialized in weapons): Unlocks "Excellent Sniper Railgun" with unique "Precision Targeting" perk
- Entity B (Intelligence 60, generalist): Unlocks "Average Rapid-Fire Railgun" with standard attributes
- Same archetype, different quality and variants based on researcher capabilities

**Procedural Benefits:**
- Each playthrough has unique tech unlocks
- Researcher capabilities create meaningful choices

## Implementation Notes

### PureDOTS Integration

**Components:**
- `TechFlavor : IComponentData` - Flavor axis values (alignment/outlook/behavior derived)
- `TechBranch : IComponentData` - Branch information (divergent/convergent)
- `TechPrerequisite : IBufferElementData` - Prerequisites for convergent techs
- `TechUnlock : IBufferElementData` - Unlocked tech variants

**Systems:**
- `TechFlavorSystem` - Derives flavor values from alignment/outlook/behavior
- `TechBranchSystem` - Manages divergent/convergent tech paths
- `TechUnlockSystem` - Unlocks tech variants based on flavors

**Authoring:**
- `TechFlavorAuthoring` - MonoBehaviour for authoring flavor mappings
- `TechBranchAuthoring` - Authoring for branching paths
- Editor tools for visualizing tech trees with flavors

### Game-Specific Adaptations

**Godgame:**
- Map flavors to spells, skills, augments, weapons, equipment
- Visual presentation based on outlook combinations
- Narrative integration (spells reflect village culture)

**Space4X:**
- Map flavors to weapons, modules, facilities, implants
- Visual presentation based on faction outlook
- Strategic integration (tech choices reflect faction values)

## Open Questions

1. **Flavor Blending:** How to handle entities with mixed outlooks? (Weighted blending vs dominant flavor)
2. **Flavor Evolution:** Do flavors change as entities evolve? (Dynamic flavor updates)
3. **Flavor Conflicts:** What happens when prerequisites conflict? (Resolution system)
4. **Flavor Visualization:** How to present flavor choices to players? (UI/UX design)
5. **Flavor Balance:** How to ensure all flavors are viable? (Balance considerations)

---

**For Designers:** Use tech flavors to create meaningful strategic choices. Each outlook combination should have unique tech paths that feel distinct and valuable.

**For Implementers:** Create data-driven flavor system that maps alignment/outlook/behavior to tech variants. Support runtime flavor changes with tech updates.

**For Artists:** Use flavor mappings to create distinct visual identities for tech variants. Each flavor should be immediately recognizable.
