## Purpose

This document defines **tech flavors** - the thematic and mechanical variations of technologies based on alignment, outlook, and behavior combinations. Tech flavors enable:

- **Cross-family techs:** Universal modifications that apply across multiple tech families
- **Divergent techs:** Branching paths where one tech splits into multiple specialized variants
- **Outlook-specific techs:** Unique technologies unlocked by specific alignment/outlook combinations
- **Convergent techs:** Multiple paths merging into advanced combined technologies

**Core Principle:** The same base technology (e.g., "Railgun") can manifest differently based on cultural values, creating distinct gameplay paths and strategic choices.

---

## Overview: Tech Flavors System

### What Are Tech Flavors?

**Tech flavors** are semantic modifiers that transform base technologies into culturally-appropriate variants. They emerge from:

1. **Alignment values** (Moral, Order, Purity)
2. **Outlook combinations** (Warlike, Spiritual, Materialist, etc.)
3. **Behavior profiles** (Might/Magic affinity, Vengeful/Forgiving, etc.)

**PureDOTS provides:**
- Base tech definitions (what the tech does mechanically)
- Flavor axis values (how it's expressed culturally)
- No hardcoded flavor names (games interpret)

**Games interpret:**
- Map flavor values to specific tech variants
- Create flavor names (e.g., "Sniper Railgun" vs "Rapid-Fire Railgun")
- Define flavor-specific mechanics and visuals

### Flavor Categories

**1. Cross-Family Flavors:**
- Universal modifications that apply to multiple tech families
- Example: "Rapid cooling" can apply to lasers, railguns, missiles, spells, or even limbs.

**2. Divergent Flavors:**
- Base tech splits into specialized branches
- Example: Railgun → Sniper Railgun (long range, high damage) OR Rapid-Fire Railgun (high RoF, lower damage)

**3. Convergent Flavors:**
- Multiple techs merge into advanced combined tech
- Example: Laser + Missile → Laser-Guided Missiles

**4. Outlook-Specific Flavors:**
- Unique techs only available to specific outlook combinations
- Example: Xenophobic Warlike → "Purification Beams" (anti-alien weapons)

**5. Special Flavors:**
- Rare or unique techs with special requirements
- Example: Fanatic Spiritual + Pure → "Divine Weapons" (holy damage)

## Research Mechanics

### Research Organization Models

**Research can be organized in two ways, determined by aggregate profile:**

**1. Centralized Research (Lawful, Authoritarian aggregates):**
- Research decisions made by aggregate leadership or player
- Entities follow assigned research projects
- Coordinated research efforts, shared resources
- Specialization through designated research teams
- Example: Lawful Authoritarian village assigns scholars to specific projects

**2. Independent Research (Chaotic, Egalitarian aggregates):**
- Entities pursue their own research projects
- No central coordination, organic discovery
- Chaotic entities will pursue their own projects regardless of aggregate decisions
- Egalitarian entities may collaborate but maintain autonomy
- Example: Chaotic village scholars research whatever interests them

**3. Hybrid Models:**
- **Lawful Egalitarian:** Democratic research decisions, but entities follow collective choices
- **Chaotic Authoritarian:** Leaders assign projects, but chaotic entities may ignore assignments
- **Neutral:** Mix of centralized and independent based on context

### Research Specialization

**Entities can specialize in specific research fields:**

**Specialization Mechanics:**
