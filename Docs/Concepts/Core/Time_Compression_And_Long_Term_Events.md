# Time Compression and Long-Term Events System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Core / Simulation / Time  
**Related Systems**: Time System, Event System, Procedural World Generation

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Handling events that span multiple days/weeks:
- Multi-day/week events (construction, travel, training)
- Time scaling (fast-forward mechanics)
- Event queuing (things that happen in future)
- Historical timeline (tracking events over long periods)
- Time compression for long simulations

---

## Key Questions

- How do multi-day events work (construction, travel)?
- How does time scaling work (fast-forward)?
- How are future events scheduled?
- How is historical timeline tracked?
- How does time compression affect simulation accuracy?
- How do entities handle long-term goals?

---

## Integration Points

- **Time System**: Core time tracking
- **Event System**: Event scheduling
- **Procedural World Generation**: Long-term world changes
- **Construction System**: Multi-day building
- **Travel System**: Long-distance travel
- **Training System**: Long-term skill improvement

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Long-term event representation (how to model multi-day events)
- [ ] Time scaling mechanics (how fast-forward works)
- [ ] Event scheduling (how future events are queued)
- [ ] Historical timeline structure (how history is stored)
- [ ] Time compression accuracy (trade-offs)
- [ ] Entity awareness of time (do entities plan long-term?)
