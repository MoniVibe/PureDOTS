## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Market and economic mechanics:
- Dynamic pricing (supply/demand affects prices)
- Market systems (how prices are determined)
- Trade routes (profitable paths)
- Economic warfare (embargoes, resource manipulation)
- Currency systems (if applicable)

---

## Key Questions

- How are prices determined (supply/demand model)?
- How do markets form and operate?
- How do trade routes become profitable?
- How does economic warfare work (embargoes, sanctions)?
- Is there currency or barter-only?
- How do prices affect entity behavior?

---

## Integration Points

- **Inventory System**: Resources have value
- **Trade System**: Trade uses prices
- **Resource System**: Resource availability affects prices
- **Relations System**: Relations affect trade prices
- **Forces System**: Economic warfare
- **Logistics System**: Trade routes require transport

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Pricing model (supply/demand calculation)
- [ ] Market structure (centralized vs distributed)
- [ ] Trade route mechanics (how routes form)
- [ ] Economic warfare mechanics (embargoes, etc.)
- [ ] Currency system (if using currency)
- [ ] Price volatility (how prices change over time)
