## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Leadership mechanics for aggregates:
- How leaders are chosen (election, inheritance, combat?)
- Leadership succession (what happens when leader dies?)
- Leadership challenges (rebellion, coups)
- Authority decay (losing respect over time)
- Leadership effectiveness

---

## Key Questions

- How are leaders chosen (election, inheritance, combat, appointment)?
- What happens when leader dies (immediate succession vs power vacuum)?
- How do leadership challenges work (rebellions, coups)?
- Does authority decay over time (losing respect)?
- How does leadership effectiveness work?
- How do leaders maintain power?

---

## Integration Points

- **Aggregate Politics**: Leaders affect aggregate decisions
- **Relations System**: Leadership affects relations
- **Reputation System**: Leadership affects reputation
- **Forces System**: Leaders command forces
- **Rebellion Mechanics**: Leadership challenges
- **Tactical Commands**: Leaders issue commands

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Leadership selection method (election, inheritance, etc.)
- [ ] Succession rules (how new leaders are chosen)
- [ ] Challenge mechanics (how challenges work)
- [ ] Authority model (how authority is tracked)
- [ ] Leadership effectiveness (how leaders affect aggregates)
- [ ] Power maintenance (how leaders stay in power)
