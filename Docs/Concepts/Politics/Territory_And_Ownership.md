## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Territorial control and ownership:

- Ownership disputes (how conflicts over territory resolve)
- Zone control (how formations/forces control areas)
- Resource rights (who can gather where)
- Territorial expansion and contraction

## Key Questions

- How do entities claim territory?
- How are borders defined and maintained?
- How do territorial disputes resolve (violence vs negotiation)?
- How does zone control work (what gives control)?
- How do resource rights work (who can gather where)?
- How does territory affect relations between entities?

- **Aggregate Politics**: Aggregates claim territory
- **Combat System**: Territory disputes lead to combat
- **Resource System**: Territory affects resource access
- **Relations System**: Territory disputes affect relations
- **Formations System**: Formations control zones

- [ ] Control calculation (what gives control over area?)
- [ ] Dispute resolution (how conflicts are resolved)
- [ ] Resource rights model (who can access what)
