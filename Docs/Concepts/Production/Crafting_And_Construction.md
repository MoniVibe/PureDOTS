# Crafting and Construction System

## Overview

**Status**: Stub - Awaiting Design  
**Category**: Production / Economy  
**Related Systems**: Blueprint System, Inventory System, Resource System, Skills System

## Core Concept

[To be designed]

Crafting and construction mechanics:
- Recipe systems (what can be crafted from what)
- Construction progress (multi-step building)
- Quality variation (crafted items have quality levels)
- Material requirements (need specific resources)
- Crafting skills and expertise

---

## Key Questions

- How are recipes defined (what can be crafted)?
- How does multi-step construction work?
- How is quality determined (random, skill-based)?
- What are material requirements (resources needed)?
- How do skills affect crafting/construction?
- How does construction progress over time?

---

## Integration Points

- **Blueprint System**: Blueprints define what can be built
- **Inventory System**: Materials come from inventory
- **Resource System**: Resources are materials
- **Skills System**: Skills affect crafting quality
- **Time System**: Construction takes time
- **Economy System**: Crafted items have value

## Design Decisions Needed

- [ ] Recipe system design (how recipes are defined)
- [ ] Construction progress model (how progress is tracked)
- [ ] Quality system (how quality is determined)
- [ ] Material requirement validation (when to check materials)
- [ ] Skill effects on crafting (how skills affect results)
- [ ] Construction time model (how time affects construction)
