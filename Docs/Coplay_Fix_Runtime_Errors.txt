TASK: Fix Critical DOTS Runtime Errors Preventing Camera Rendering

CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. ✅ FIXED: Singleton Duplicates - Code fix applied (SingletonCleanupSystem.cs)
   - HistorySettings, PoolingSettings, TimeSettingsConfig have 2-3 entities instead of 1
   - Fixed by: SingletonCleanupSystem removes duplicates in InitializationSystemGroup

2. ✅ FIXED: Job Data Initialization - Code fix applied (VesselAISystem.cs, VesselTargetingSystem.cs)
   - ResourceEntries NativeArray disposed before job completes
   - Carriers NativeList disposed before job completes
   - Fixed by: Using TempJob allocator and ensuring job completes before disposal

3. ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL FIX: URP Render Pipeline Not Loading
   - "No SRP present, no compute shader support..." error
   - URP Asset GUID: 4b83569d67af61e458304325a23e5dfd
   - Check: Edit > Project Settings > Graphics > Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings
   - Verify: URP Asset is assigned

4. ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL FIX: Duplicate Main Camera in SubScene
   - Main Camera exists in "New Sub Scene" subscene
   - Should only exist in main scene
   - Action: Delete or disable camera in subscene

REQUIRED ACTIONS:

A. VERIFY URP RENDER PIPELINE:
   1. In Unity Editor:
      - Edit > Project Settings > Graphics
      - Check "Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings" field
      - Should have URP Asset assigned (GUID: 4b83569d67af61e458304325a23e5dfd)
      - If empty, assign the URP Asset from Assets/
   2. Also check Quality Settings:
      - Edit > Project Settings > Quality
      - For each quality level, verify Render Pipeline Asset is assigned

B. REMOVE DUPLICATE CAMERA FROM SUBSCENE:
   1. Open subscene "New Sub Scene.unity" (or find in hierarchy)
   2. Find "Main Camera" GameObject inside subscene
   3. Either:
      - Delete the Main Camera GameObject from subscene
      - OR disable its Camera component
   4. Verify only ONE Main Camera exists in main scene

C. VERIFY CODE FIXES ARE ACTIVE:
   1. Check console in Play Mode:
      - Should see "[SingletonCleanup] Found X entities (expected 1). Removing duplicates..."
      - Should NOT see "InvalidOperationException: Multiple entities found"
      - Should NOT see "UNKNOWN_OBJECT_TYPE" or "NativeList ... has not been assigned"
   2. If still seeing singleton errors:
      - Check SingletonCleanupSystem.cs exists in Assets/Scripts/Space4x/Systems/
      - Verify it's in InitializationSystemGroup with OrderFirst=true

D. VERIFY SYSTEMS RUNNING:
   1. Enter Play Mode
   2. Check console for:
      - "[SingletonCleanup] Cleanup complete" (should appear early)
      - "[VesselAISystem] Found X vessels..." (should NOT crash)
      - "[VesselTargetingSystem] Found X vessels..." (should NOT crash)
      - "[Space4XCameraRenderSyncSystem] Found/Created Main Camera"
   3. No exceptions should appear in console

MCP TOOLS TO USE:
- manage_scene get_hierarchy (check for duplicate cameras)
- manage_gameobject find by_component "Camera" (list all cameras)
- manage_gameobject delete (remove duplicate camera from subscene)
- manage_asset get_info (check URP asset exists)

IF MCP CAN'T ACCESS GRAPHICS SETTINGS:
- Manual steps:
  1. Edit > Project Settings > Graphics
  2. Assign URP Asset to "Scriptable Render Pipeline Settings"
  3. Edit > Project Settings > Quality
  4. For each quality level, assign URP Asset to "Render Pipeline Asset"

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ No "InvalidOperationException: Multiple entities found" errors
- ✅ No "UNKNOWN_OBJECT_TYPE" or "NativeList ... has not been assigned" errors
- ✅ No "No SRP present" error (URP Asset is assigned)
- ✅ Only ONE Main Camera in main scene (not in subscene)
- ✅ Console shows "[SingletonCleanup] Cleanup complete"
- ✅ Camera systems running without exceptions
- ✅ Game View shows rendered scene (not "Display 1 no camera rendering")

TEST AFTER FIXES:
1. Exit Play Mode
2. Delete Library/ folder (optional, forces recompile)
3. Re-enter Play Mode
4. Check console - should be clean of singleton/job errors
5. Game View should render scene
