TASK: Fix Missing Script References and SubScene Link

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:

1. ✅ FIXED: SubScene GUID Mismatch
   - SubScene was pointing to wrong GUID (e79f3a924132fcf40a3afdb1fd451bca)
   - Updated to correct GUID: 106a2d17480e4f49a581c054882707df (GameEntities.unity)
   - Fixed _SceneAsset and _SceneGUID values

2. ⚠️ NEEDS MANUAL FIX: Missing Script References on Main Camera
   - Components at index 3 and 4 are missing scripts
   - This happens when MonoBehaviours are deleted but references remain
   - Unity Editor will need to clean these up

REQUIRED ACTIONS:

A. REMOVE MISSING SCRIPT REFERENCES FROM MAIN CAMERA:
   Option 1 (Recommended - Manual):
   1. Select "Main Camera" GameObject in Hierarchy
   2. In Inspector, you'll see "Missing (Mono Script)" components
   3. Click the three dots (⋮) next to each missing script
   4. Select "Remove Component"
   
   Option 2 (MCP):
   - Use manage_gameobject get_components "Main Camera"
   - Identify which components have missing scripts
   - Use manage_gameobject remove_component to remove them

B. VERIFY SUBSCENE LINK IS FIXED:
   1. Select "New Sub Scene" GameObject in Hierarchy
   2. In Inspector, check SubScene component
   3. "Scene Asset" should point to "GameEntities" (not empty or wrong scene)
   4. If still broken, manually assign: Assets/Scenes/GameEntities.unity

C. ADDRESS AUTHORING WARNINGS (Optional but Recommended):
   1. VillagerSpawnerAuthoring warnings:
      - Find VillagerSpawner GameObjects in scene
      - Assign villager prefab to the "Villager Prefab" field
      - OR remove VillagerSpawnerAuthoring if not needed
   
   2. SpatialPartitionAuthoring warnings:
      - Find GameObjects with SpatialPartitionAuthoring
      - Assign a SpatialPartitionProfile asset
      - OR remove component if not needed

MCP TOOLS TO USE:
- manage_gameobject get_components "Main Camera" (check for missing scripts)
- manage_gameobject remove_component (remove missing script components)
- manage_scene get_hierarchy (verify subscene link)

MANUAL STEPS IF MCP CAN'T REMOVE MISSING SCRIPTS:
1. In Unity Editor:
   - Select Main Camera in Hierarchy
   - Inspector shows missing script components
   - Right-click each "Missing (Mono Script)" → Remove Component
   - OR: Right-click GameObject → Remove Component → select missing script

2. Fix SubScene link:
   - Select "New Sub Scene" GameObject
   - In SubScene component, click the circle icon next to "Scene Asset"
   - Navigate to Assets/Scenes/GameEntities.unity
   - Assign it

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- ✅ No "The referenced script is missing" warnings
- ✅ SubScene component points to GameEntities.unity
- ✅ No "Loading Entity Scene failed" errors
- ✅ Subscene loads and bakes correctly

AFTER FIXES:
1. The subscene should now load properly
2. GameObjects in subscene should bake into entities
3. Console should show entities being created (vessels, villagers, resources)
