# Headless Runbook - Build Channels + Test Bank (TRI)

Purpose: keep headless agents productive without rebuild churn and protect a pinned current build by enforcing:
1) two build channels (scratch vs current),
2) a promotion gate (bank green/stable),
3) a test bank (tiered, explicit pass signals).

This runbook splits headless validation into two agents with per-project banks.

## Cross-OS caveats
- Avoid editing `Assets/` or `.meta` from WSL; presentation owns those files.
- Keep `Packages/manifest.json` and `Packages/packages-lock.json` synced across clones when logic changes.
- Headless rebuilds in WSL should use Windows Unity interop (set `FORCE_WINDOWS_UNITY=1`); do not rely on Linux Unity licensing.
- Align Unity versions before rebuilds: read `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` in the target repo and set `UNITY_WIN` to that exact version; treat any mismatch as a stale build and fix before proceeding.

## Productivity requirement (non-negotiable)
- Each cycle must attempt at least one headlesstask from `headlesstasks.md`.
- If telemetry already exposes the metric, compute it and update `headlesstasks.md` (status, baseline/threshold, notes).
- If the metric is missing, add minimal telemetry in logic repos (PureDOTS) and rebuild; if it requires `Assets/` or `.meta` edits, log the requirement and switch to another task.
- Do not end a cycle with only bank runs; the bank is gating, not sufficient.

## Compile-error remediation (non-negotiable)
- If a rebuild fails with compiler errors, attempt a minimal, logic-only fix, rebuild scratch, then rerun Tier 0.
- If the compiler errors point to `Assets/` or `.meta` and the agent is running in WSL, log the blocker and switch tasks; do not edit those files from WSL.
- If the agent is running in a Windows/presentation context, it may fix `Assets/` or `.meta` compiler errors before retrying the rebuild.
- Record compile-fix attempts in the cycle log and note any blockers in `headlesstasks.md`.

## Asset-fix escalation (Windows-only)
- If a bank failure or headless task requires `Assets/` or `.meta` edits and a Windows/presentation context is available, switch to that mode for the fix only.
- Keep edits minimal and limited to headless-critical assets (scenarios, headless scenes, headless ScriptableObjects, proof/config assets).
- If Windows mode is not available, add a one-line request to `headless_asset_queue.md` with: paths, desired change, repro command, and why it blocks the bank.
- After any asset fix, rebuild scratch, rerun the impacted bank tier(s), and update the runbook/prompt if expectations or toggles changed.
- Asset import failures are rebuild-blocking, not run-blocking: continue the cycle using the current build and note that it is stale; only promote after the asset fix is applied.

---

## Agent split (per-project banks)

- Godgame headless agent: only builds/runs Godgame; uses the Godgame bank only.
- Space4X headless agent: only builds/runs Space4X; uses the Space4X bank only.
- Banks are per project; do not block Godgame on Space4X failures (or vice versa).
- P0.TIME_REWIND_MICRO runs in both banks, using each project's headless binary.

---

## Build Channels (scratch vs current)

Definitions (per project):
- scratch build: any build produced during the shift for that project
- current build: the pinned build used by others for that project (must remain stable)

Rules:
1) Scratch builds may be rebuilt at will.
2) Do not overwrite current build artifacts with scratch output.
3) Promote scratch -> current only when that project's bank is green and stable.
4) Promotion gate: Tier 0 passes twice consecutively (same seed), then Tier 1 passes once (or twice if affordable).
5) Two-fail rule for escalation: a failure is actionable only after 2 consecutive FAIL runs (same seed).
6) Keep artifacts for every promoted build (binary + logs + telemetry).

---

## Bank Contract (Non-negotiables)

- Tier 0 is a gate per project: if any Tier 0 test fails in that bank, stop and triage until green before Tier 1/2.
- Two-green rule: a tier is stable only after 2 consecutive PASS runs (same seed).
- Two-fail rule: treat a failure as real only after 2 consecutive FAIL runs (same seed).
- Seed + minimum simSeconds are required for every bank entry; report both after each run.
- Current build is immutable during a shift; scratch builds may be rebuilt at will, but do not promote until the gate passes.
- Each cycle must include concrete headlesstask progress (see `headlesstasks.md`) and be recorded in `headless_agent_log.md`.
- Prefer changes that can be validated without rebuilding:
  - Scenario JSON (swap/copy into build folder)
  - Environment flags (proof toggles, telemetry level, thresholds)
  - Report/telemetry output paths
- If a proof is incompatible with a scenario, disable it for that scenario and document the reason in the headless proof system.
- Space4X proof toggles are scenario-specific: set `SPACE4X_HEADLESS_MINING_PROOF=1` for S0/S1/S2 mining scenarios, unset/0 for S0 collision, and set `SPACE4X_HEADLESS_BEHAVIOR_PROOF=1` for S5.

Telemetry defaults (use unless debugging):
- PUREDOTS_TELEMETRY_LEVEL=summary
- PUREDOTS_TELEMETRY_MAX_BYTES=524288000

---

## Machine-checkable PASS/FAIL contract

Required log markers (exact strings):
- Logs must contain: BANK:<testId>:PASS
- Logs must not contain: BANK:<testId>:FAIL
- Logs must contain exactly one telemetry path line: TELEMETRY_OUT:<path>
- Every BANK line must include: tickTime=<TickTimeState.Tick>, scenarioTick=<ScenarioRunnerTick>, delta=<tickTime-scenarioTick>
stdout is the source of truth for harness parsing; BANK and TELEMETRY_OUT must be written to stdout (not stderr).
Optional: emit TAP ok/not ok lines in addition to BANK markers.

PASS is only when:
- exit code is 0
- required PASS proof lines exist
- no FAIL proof lines
- telemetry file exists, is fresh, and size <= cap

FAIL is when:
- exit code != 0
- any FAIL lines
- missing or stale telemetry
- telemetry exceeds cap (unless explicitly allowed for a deep-dive run)

Note: Proof systems and scenario entry points must emit the BANK and TELEMETRY_OUT lines. If they do not, add them in the headless proof system when batching a rebuild.

---

## Promotion Gate (scratch -> current)

Promote only if (per project):
- Tier 0 is green twice (two-green, same seed), and
- Tier 1 is green once (or twice if affordable).

---

## Failure triage (two-fail rule)

Before escalating a failure or blocking promotion:
1) Re-run the same scenario twice (same seed), confirm failure is repeatable.
2) Confirm proof enable/disable env flags are correct.
3) Confirm scenario spawns required subjects for the proof (villagers/storehouse, mining vessels, strike craft, etc.).
4) Ensure telemetry output is fresh (truncate/rotate between runs).
5) Only then escalate.

Note: authoring/baker/SubScene changes typically require rebuild; scenario/env changes do not.

---

## Cycle close-out (staleness check)

- Before ending a cycle, confirm the runbook/prompt reflect any proof/env toggle changes, bank expectation edits, or bank failures that were fixed.
- If you cannot update the docs in the same cycle, log a TODO in `headlesstasks.md` and mark the section that must be refreshed.

---

## Scratch rebuild policy

Scratch rebuilds are allowed and encouraged for fast iteration, but:
- never overwrite current build artifacts
- rerun the affected bank tier(s) after each scratch build
- do not promote until the promotion gate is satisfied

Avoid scratch rebuilds during active presentation/editor sessions unless coordinated.

---

## Build stamping + artifact retention

Every scratch build should emit a single stamp line early:
- BUILD_STAMP: sha=<...> utc=<...> unity=<...> bank_rev=<...>

bank_rev should map to the test bank revision (runbook update or version tag).
Keep artifacts for every promoted build (binary + logs + telemetry) for traceability.

---

## Time + rewind telemetry pack (required)

Minimum metrics:
- time.tick, time.fixedDelta, time.speed, time.isPaused, time.isPlaying
- scenario.tick, time.tick_minus_scenario_tick
- rewind.mode, rewind.isActive, rewind.targetTick, rewind.progressTicks
- rewind.subjectCount, rewind.snapshotCount, rewind.snapshotBytes

Minimum events (sparse):
- time.pause, time.play, time.setspeed, time.step
- rewind.start, rewind.stop, rewind.apply_snapshot
- timebubble.add_probe, timebubble.remove_probe

---

## Telemetry hygiene

- Keep metric/event names stable and hierarchical (time.*, rewind.*, scenario.*).
- Use consistent attribute keys; keep units in metadata, not in names.
- Treat logs, metrics, and events as a correlated pack for time/rewind runs.

---

## Time/rewind rebuild batch (do all three)

When batching a rebuild for time/rewind reliability, include:
1) Scenario-aware proof so ScenarioRunner commands do not fight proofs.
2) Explicit fail if ScenarioRunnerTick advances but TickTimeState does not.
3) Sparse bubble membership markers to debug time bubbles.

---

## Overnight work without promoting current build

Allowed:
1) Scenario JSON tweaks (counts, spawn distances, durations, scripted actions)
2) Env flag tuning (proof toggles, thresholds, telemetry levels)
3) Telemetry output/report path changes
4) Report hygiene (fresh output, size cap honored)
5) Scratch rebuilds to validate code changes

Not allowed without promotion:
- overwriting the current build
- promoting scratch without meeting the promotion gate

If a code fix is needed:
- implement the change in a PR
- validate via a scratch build
- add a reproduction command + which bank entry it unblocks
- tag it REBUILD_BATCH_CANDIDATE

---

## Nightly backlog format

- Test: <testId>
- Build ID: <commit SHA or build stamp>
- Seed: <seed>
- Minimum simSeconds: <value>
- Repro command: <exact CLI + env>
- Observed: <exit code, FAIL line, missing telemetry, perf budget fail>
- Expected: <PASS line + telemetry loop proof>
- Likely slice: Body / Mind / Aggregate + suspected system(s)
- Fix type: Scenario | Env | Code(PR)
- Status: Investigating | Mitigated(no rebuild) | PR opened | Needs rebuild batch
- Artifacts: logs + telemetry ndjson path

---

## Promotion request template (scratch -> current)

- Project: Godgame | Space4X
- Scratch build stamp: (BUILD_STAMP line)
- Bank evidence: Tier 0 two-green, Tier 1 pass (or two-green if required) for that project
- Artifacts: binary + logs + telemetry paths
- PRs included: (list)
- Expected impact: (which tests flip red to green)
- Post-promotion plan: (run full bank once; if green, freeze promotions)
