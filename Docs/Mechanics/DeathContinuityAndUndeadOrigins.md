# Death Continuity & Undead Origins

**Status**: Concept
**Complexity**: High
**Last Updated**: 2025-12-01
**Content Warning**: ⚠️ Death, necromancy, body horror (Mature 17+)

---

## Overview

**One-Line**: Every undead entity and spirit originates from actual entities that lived and died in the simulation, creating continuity and narrative depth.

**Core Question**: What if every skeleton's bones, every spirit's haunting, and every zombie's flesh came from real entities with histories?

**Key Tension**: Preserving identity vs losing it, moving on vs being trapped, redemption vs corruption.

---

## Core Concept

In PureDOTS, **death is not the end of simulation relevance**. When entities die, their physical remains and spiritual essence persist in the world and can be:

- **Reanimated** as undead (skeletons, zombies, patchwork abominations)
- **Bound** as spirits (ghosts, wraiths, specters)
- **Harvested** for necromantic materials (bones, organs, souls)
- **Remembered** by survivors (grief, vengeance, legacy)

**No Random Spawns**: Necromancers cannot conjure undead from nothing. Every skeleton was once a living person. Every spirit haunting a location died there. Every patchwork abomination is stitched from multiple corpses, each with their own history.

This creates:
- **Narrative Continuity**: Undead have backstories, relationships, unfinished business
- **Recognition Moments**: Villagers recognize reanimated loved ones, react emotionally
- **Redemption Arcs**: Forsaken undead seek to return to true life
- **Moving On**: Spirits try to resolve unfinished business and pass on

---

## How It Works

### 1. Death Registry & Corpse Tracking

When an entity dies, the simulation tracks:

**Death Record**:
- Entity ID of deceased
- Cause of death (combat, disease, old age, starvation, sacrifice)
- Time of death (tick)
- Location of death (coordinates)
- Body state (intact, damaged, burned, dismembered)
- Social context (who witnessed, who mourns, who celebrates)

**Corpse Entity**:
- Physical entity representing the body
- Linked to original entity ID (traceable history)
- Decay progression (Fresh → Rotting → Skeletal → Dust)
- Harvestable components (bones, organs, skin, soul fragment)
- Location tracking (burial site, battlefield, necromancer's lab)

**Spirit Fragment**:
- Non-corporeal entity tied to death location or emotional anchor
- Retains memories, personality echoes, unfinished business
- Can manifest as ghost, haunt location, or be bound by necromancer
- Fade over time unless anchored (grief, vengeance, unresolved trauma)

### 2. Undead Creation from Corpses

**Necromantic Reanimation** requires:
- **Source Material**: Corpse(s) from Death Registry
- **Necromancer Skill**: Higher skill = better undead quality
- **Ritual/Magic**: Time, mana, ritual components
- **Binding**: Necromancer's will binds spirit fragment or creates puppet

**Undead Types**:

**Skeleton**:
- Requires: 1 skeletal corpse (decayed or cleaned bones)
- Source Entity: Single deceased entity
- Retains: None (mindless puppet) OR Echoes (if forsaken undead)
- Narrative Hook: Villagers recognize bone structure, clothing remnants

**Zombie**:
- Requires: 1 fresh-to-rotting corpse
- Source Entity: Single deceased entity
- Retains: Muscle memory, vague recognition of familiar faces
- Narrative Hook: Shambles toward former home, former loved ones horrified

**Patchwork Abomination**:
- Requires: Multiple corpses (3-10 body parts from different sources)
- Source Entities: Each limb/organ traced to different deceased entity
- Retains: Fragmented memories from multiple sources (conflicted, mad)
- Narrative Hook: "That's my father's arm... and my brother's leg..."

**Forsaken Undead** (Special):
- Entity died with strong will, bound themselves to corpse before passing
- Retains: Full memories, personality, skills (but undead body)
- Goal: Seek resurrection, redemption, or acceptance of undeath
- Narrative Hook: "I remember you... please, help me return to life"

### 3. Spirit Manifestation from Deaths

**Spirit Types**:

**Ghost** (Bound to Location):
- Spawns where entity died violently or with unfinished business
- Haunts death location (battlefield, murder site, betrayal scene)
- Manifests during conditions tied to death (time of day, weather, anniversary)
- Can be laid to rest by resolving unfinished business

**Wraith** (Consumed by Vengeance):
- Spawns from entity who died with intense hatred/betrayal
- Seeks revenge on killer or those responsible
- Hostile, relentless, ignores former allies
- Can be pacified by avenging their death or exorcism

**Specter** (Bound by Grief):
- Spawns from entity whose death caused massive grief (beloved leader, parent, child)
- Lingers near mourners, trying to comfort or warn
- Non-hostile, but presence causes emotional distress
- Moves on when mourners achieve closure

**Ancestor Spirit** (Honored Dead):
- Entity died peacefully, honored by descendants
- Manifests during rituals, ceremonies, or crises
- Provides guidance, blessings, protection
- Voluntary manifestation, not trapped

### 4. Narrative Recognition System

**Recognition Mechanics**:

When undead/spirit encounters entity from their past life:
- **Relationship Check**: Were they family, friend, enemy, stranger?
- **Emotional Response**: Joy, horror, grief, anger, confusion
- **Behavioral Change**: Undead may hesitate to attack former loved ones
- **Player Choice**: Allow reanimation despite recognition, or spare/destroy undead

**Example Recognition Scenarios**:

**Skeleton of Fallen Guard**:
- Guard dies defending village from raiders
- Necromancer raises guard's skeleton months later
- Skeleton attacks village alongside undead horde
- Former comrades recognize shield emblem, armor dents
- "That's Gareth... we buried him with honors..."
- **Player Choice**:
  - Destroy skeleton (put Gareth to rest)
  - Capture skeleton (try to restore Gareth's spirit)
  - Ignore (let skeleton continue attacking)

**Zombie Mother**:
- Mother dies from plague
- Daughter survives, grieves
- Necromancer raises mother as zombie
- Zombie shambles toward former home
- Daughter sees mother approaching: "Mom...?"
- **Player Choice**:
  - Daughter embraces zombie (infected, becomes zombie)
  - Daughter flees in horror (trauma, breakdown)
  - Village destroys zombie (daughter's grief intensifies)

**Patchwork Knight**:
- 5 knights die in battle against demon
- Necromancer stitches them into single abomination
- Abomination has conflicting memories: "Where am I? My wife... no, my brother... the demon... we failed..."
- Surviving knights recognize comrades' limbs: "That's Sir Roland's sword arm... and Sir Benton's shield..."
- **Player Choice**:
  - Destroy abomination (mercy kill)
  - Separate limbs, bury individually (costly but honorable)
  - Study abomination (cruel, but learn necromancer's location)

### 5. Forsaken Undead Redemption Arcs

**Forsaken Undead** are rare entities who bound their soul to their corpse before death, retaining full consciousness in undead form.

**Creation Conditions**:
- Entity must have **strong will** (Willpower 80%+)
- Entity must **choose** to bind themselves (not forced)
- Entity must die with **unfinished purpose** (quest, oath, duty)
- Ritual knowledge (rare, requires preparation)

**Forsaken Undead Traits**:
- Retain memories, personality, skills
- Suffer from undead body limitations (decay, revulsion, no healing)
- Social pariah status (most view as abomination)
- Desperate for resurrection or acceptance

**Redemption Paths**:

**Path 1: Resurrection Quest**:
- Forsaken seeks powerful cleric/mage to restore true life
- Requires rare components (phoenix feather, god's blessing, soul anchor)
- Player can help gather components
- **Success**: Forsaken returns to life, grateful ally
- **Failure**: Forsaken accepts undeath, becomes tragic figure

**Path 2: Complete Unfinished Business**:
- Forsaken bound themselves to complete a quest/oath
- Player helps forsaken complete their purpose
- Upon completion, forsaken's soul is released, moves on
- **Result**: Bittersweet (forsaken dies permanently, but at peace)

**Path 3: Acceptance**:
- Forsaken learns to live as undead
- Finds purpose despite undead state (protector, scholar, hermit)
- Player can provide sanctuary, social acceptance
- **Result**: Forsaken becomes unique NPC, bridge between living and dead

### 6. Spirit Moving On

**Unfinished Business Resolution**:

Spirits linger due to unresolved matters. Player (or entities) can help spirits move on:

**Vengeance Wraith**:
- Spirit bound by desire for revenge on killer
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Kill the murderer (spirit satisfied, moves on)
  - Bring murderer to justice (spirit accepts, moves on)
  - Prove murderer has reformed (spirit forgives, moves on)
  - Exorcise spirit (forceful, spirit may resist)

**Grief Specter**:
- Spirit lingers because mourners cannot let go
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Help mourners achieve closure (therapy, ritual, time)
  - Spirit delivers final message to mourners
  - Mourners perform burial rites properly
  - Spirit sees mourners moving forward with life

**Lost Child Spirit**:
- Child died before completing rite of passage or saying goodbye
- **Resolution Options**:
  - Complete rite of passage on child's behalf
  - Reunite spirit with deceased parents in afterlife
  - Adopt child's orphaned sibling (child sees sibling safe)
  - Tell child's story so they're remembered

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Limb & Organ Grafting (Cross-Reference)
- **Harvesting**: Corpses are primary source for graftable limbs/organs
- **Traceability**: Grafted limb retains link to original deceased entity
- **Social Stigma**: Grafting corpse parts viewed as necromantic by some cultures
- **Recognition**: "That's my father's arm you're wearing!"

### Consciousness Transference (Cross-Reference)
- **Spirit Binding**: Necromancers can bind spirits to undead bodies
- **Forsaken Undead**: Pre-emptive consciousness transfer to own corpse
- **Memory Transfer**: Undead may retain memory fragments from source corpses

### Memories & Lessons (Cross-Reference)
- **Ancestral Spirits**: Can teach cultural memories to descendants
- **Undead Echoes**: Patchwork abominations have fragmented memories from multiple sources
- **Spirit Witnesses**: Ghosts remember events from their death (valuable information)

### Social/Reputation System
- **Necromancy Taboo**: Cultures may ban necromancy, exile necromancers
- **Desecration Response**: Villagers enraged if loved ones reanimated
- **Forsaken Acceptance**: Some cultures honor forsaken undead, others hunt them

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: The Fallen Guard (Godgame)

**Setup**:
- Guard Gareth dies defending village from raiders (heroic death)
- Village buries Gareth with honors, mourns him
- 3 months later, necromancer discovers grave, exhumes corpse
- Necromancer raises Gareth as skeleton warrior

**Progression**:
- **Reanimation**: Skeleton created with link to Gareth's death record
- **Attack**: Skeleton joins undead horde attacking village
- **Recognition**: Former comrades recognize Gareth's shield emblem, armor dents
  - "Gods... that's Gareth... we buried him ourselves..."
  - Comrade morale drops, some hesitate to fight
- **Emotional Response**: Mix of horror (desecration) and anger (necromancer's crime)

**Player Choices**:
1. **Destroy Skeleton**: Put Gareth to rest properly
   - Result: Comrades relieved, morale restored
   - Village holds second funeral
2. **Capture Skeleton**: Attempt to bind Gareth's spirit back
   - Result: Requires powerful cleric, rare ritual
   - If successful: Gareth becomes forsaken undead, seeks redemption
3. **Let Skeleton Continue**: Don't intervene
   - Result: Skeleton kills former comrades
   - Village devastated by betrayal (even though Gareth isn't in control)

---

### Scenario 2: The Patchwork Knight (Space4X)

**Setup**:
- 5 elite marines die fighting alien hive queen
- Bodies recovered, stored in morgue
- Rogue AI scientist creates cyborg abomination from their parts
- Abomination escapes, heads toward fleet

**Progression**:
- **Reanimation**: Abomination created with 5 source entities (5 buffer entries)
- **Conflicted Memories**: Each limb remembers different things
  - Right arm (Sgt. Chen): "Protect the squad..."
  - Left arm (Cpl. Martinez): "Secure the reactor..."
  - Legs (Pvt. Jackson): "Run... run from the hive..."
  - Torso (Lt. Rodriguez): "Hold the line... no retreat..."
  - Head (Pvt. Kim): "Where am I? What am I?"
- **Recognition**: Surviving squad members see abomination
  - "That's Sgt. Chen's augmented arm... and Martinez's leg servos..."
  - Horror and grief: friends stitched into monster

**Player Choices**:
1. **Destroy Abomination**: Mercy kill
   - Result: Squad relieved but traumatized
   - Bodies properly spaced (funeral in void)
2. **Study Abomination**: Learn from rogue AI's work
   - Result: Gain research data, but morally questionable
   - Squad views player as callous
3. **Separate and Bury**: Carefully dismantle, bury each part individually
   - Result: Expensive, time-consuming, but honorable
   - Squad morale restored, grateful to player

### Scenario 3: Forsaken Undead Redemption (Godgame)

**Setup**:
- Knight Sir Aldric swore oath to protect princess
- Princess kidnapped by demon cult
- Sir Aldric mortally wounded pursuing cultists
- Before death, Sir Aldric uses forbidden ritual to bind soul to corpse
- Becomes forsaken undead, continues quest

**Progression**:
- **Awakening**: Sir Aldric rises as forsaken undead (full consciousness)
- **Social Pariah**: Village recoils in horror, brands him abomination
  - Former friends: "Aldric... what have you done?"
  - Priest: "You've defied the natural order! Leave or be destroyed!"
- **Quest Continues**: Sir Aldric tracks cultists, seeks to rescue princess
- **Player Encounter**: Sir Aldric asks player for help
  - "I know I'm an abomination... but I swore an oath. Help me save her, then you can destroy me."

**Player Choices**:
1. **Help Rescue Princess**: Aid Sir Aldric's quest
   - Result: Princess rescued, Sir Aldric's oath fulfilled
   - **Sub-Choice**:
     - Destroy Sir Aldric (he accepts death peacefully)
     - Seek resurrection (gather phoenix feather, divine blessing)
     - Grant sanctuary (Sir Aldric guards princess as undead knight)
2. **Destroy Sir Aldric**: Execute him as abomination
   - Result: Princess remains captive, village approves
   - Sir Aldric's spirit lingers as wraith (unfinished business)
3. **Ignore**: Let Sir Aldric handle quest alone
   - Result: Sir Aldric likely fails, destroyed by cultists
   - Princess sacrificed, demon summoned

**Redemption Endings**:
- **Path 1 (Resurrection)**: Sir Aldric restored to life, marries princess
- **Path 2 (Completion)**: Sir Aldric's spirit released after rescue, dies at peace
- **Path 3 (Acceptance)**: Sir Aldric becomes undead guardian, finds new purpose

## Thematic Variations

### Godgame (Medieval/Divine)

**Mechanic Name**: **Necromancy, Spirit Haunting, Forsaken Knights**

**Themes**:
- Desecration of the dead as moral violation
- Spirits bound by unfinished business (revenge, grief, duty)
- Undead as tragic figures (lost souls, reanimated loved ones)
- Necromancers as villains (defying natural order)
- Forsaken undead as fallen heroes (cursed by their own oaths)

**Undead Types**:
- **Skeleton Warriors**: Reanimated bones of fallen soldiers
- **Zombie Villagers**: Plague victims or murdered innocents
- **Patchwork Flesh Golems**: Multiple corpses stitched together
- **Forsaken Knights**: Heroes who bound themselves to continue quests

**Spirit Types**:
- **Vengeful Wraiths**: Murdered victims seeking justice
- **Grief Specters**: Loved ones unable to let go
- **Ancestor Spirits**: Honored dead providing guidance

**Countermeasures**:
- Consecrated burial prevents reanimation
- Exorcism banishes spirits
- Holy relics harm undead
- Fulfilling unfinished business releases spirits

---

### Space4X (Sci-Fi/Space)

**Mechanic Name**: **Cyborg Reanimation, Ghost Signals, Digital Echoes**

**Themes**:
- Reanimation through cybernetics and neural overrides
- "Ghosts" as digital consciousness fragments in ship systems
- Patchwork cyborgs from salvaged marine parts
- Forsaken marines uploaded to cloned bodies or mech suits

**Undead Types**:
- **Reanimated Marines**: Neural implants reactivated post-mortem
- **Cyborg Zombies**: Augments keep body moving after brain death
- **Patchwork Combatants**: Multiple marine parts cybernetically integrated
- **Forsaken Pilots**: Consciousness uploaded to mech or ship before death

**Spirit Types**:
- **Ghost Signals**: AI echoes of deceased crew in ship systems
- **Vengeance Protocols**: Combat AI carrying grudges from fallen pilots
- **Mourning Subroutines**: Ship AI grieving lost crew

**Countermeasures**:
- EMP disables undead cybernetics
- Consciousness purge removes ghost signals
- Clone body transfer for forsaken (expensive)
- Proper data deletion prevents ghost manifestation

---

## Balance Considerations

### Player Agency
- Player cannot have loved ones randomly reanimated without warning
- Clear signals when necromancer is active in region (rumors, evidence)
- Option to consecrate graves, protect cemeteries

### Emotional Impact
- Recognition moments should be rare and meaningful (not every undead recognized)
- Allow player to opt-in to emotional arcs (forsaken quests)
- Provide closure options (proper burial, resurrection, moving on)

### Gameplay Integration
- Undead origins provide investigation hooks (find necromancer's lair)
- Spirit memories contain valuable information (witness accounts)
- Forsaken undead can be allies or questgivers

### Performance
- Death registry limited by retention time (old deaths pruned after X years)
- Corpse decay removes entities eventually (no infinite corpse buildup)
- Spirit manifestation limited by emotional anchor strength

---

## Implementation Notes

### System Requirements

**Death Registry System**:
- Track entity deaths, create death records
- Spawn corpse entities at death location
- Decay corpses over time (Fresh → Skeletal → Dust)

**Corpse Harvesting System**:
- Allow necromancers to harvest body parts from corpses
- Track which parts harvested from which corpse
- Consecrated corpses cannot be harvested

**Undead Creation System**:
- Validate corpse availability and quality
- Link undead to source corpse(s) via UndeadSourcePart buffer
- Calculate recognition chance based on body condition

**Recognition System**:
- Check if entities recognize undead/spirits
- Trigger emotional responses based on relationship
- Allow behavioral changes (hesitation, grief, anger)

**Spirit Manifestation System**:
- Spawn spirits at death locations or anchor points
- Check for unfinished business resolution
- Move spirits on when conditions met

### Performance Considerations

**Hot Path**:
- Death record creation (infrequent, only on deaths)
- Corpse decay (daily update, not per-tick)

**Cold Path**:
- Recognition checks (situational, only when undead/spirit encounters known entity)
- Unfinished business tracking (updated on quest events)

**Data Retention**:
- Prune old death records (10+ years)
- Remove fully decayed corpses (dust state)
- Fade unanchored spirits over time

### Related Mechanics
- **[Limb & Organ Grafting](LimbAndOrganGrafting.md)**: Corpses as graft source material
- **[Consciousness Transference](ConsciousnessTransference.md)**: Forsaken undead pre-emptive transfer
- **[Memories & Lessons](MemoriesAndLessons.md)**: Spirits retaining memories, undead echoes

### Framework Requirements
- **Death Registry**: Track all entity deaths with detailed records
- **Corpse Persistence**: Physical corpse entities that decay over time
- **Source Traceability**: Link undead/spirits to original deceased entities
- **Recognition System**: Entities identify undead/spirits from past relationships

## References

**Inspirations**:
- **Dwarf Fortress**: Dead dwarves become ghosts, haunt fortress
- **Dark Souls**: Undead curse, hollowing, humanity
- **Diablo 2**: Necromancer summoning skeletons from corpses
- **Warcraft 3**: Necromancers raising undead from battlefield corpses
- **The Witcher**: Spirits with unfinished business, contracts

**Tropes**:
- Came Back Wrong (undead resurrection)
- Unfinished Business (spirits lingering)
- Was Once a Man (recognition of former human)
- I Know You're in There Somewhere Fight (reaching undead's humanity)
- Put Them All Down (mercy kill for undead loved ones)

**Status**: Concept - needs death registry system, corpse persistence, source traceability, and recognition mechanics
**Complexity**: High - intersects with death systems, social systems, and narrative systems
**Content Rating**: Mature 17+ (death, necromancy, body horror, grief)
