# Mechanic: Limb & Organ Grafting System

## Overview

**Status**: Concept
**Complexity**: Very Complex
**Category**: Character Customization / Body Horror / Progression

**One-line description**: *Surgical grafting of limbs and organs from other entities (or augments) to gain their physical properties, with social consequences for grafted individuals viewed as abominations by purists.*

## Core Concept

Entities can **graft limbs and organs** from other creatures, races, or augment sources onto themselves (or others). Each graft carries the **physical properties** of its origin:
- **Racial Traits**: Orc arm = stronger but less accurate, Elf arm = precise but weaker
- **Species Traits**: Wyrm wing = flight, Strigoi arm = regeneration, Celestial organ = divine power
- **Augment Traits**: Bionic arm = strength + durability, Bionic eye = enhanced vision

**Dark Undertones**: This system enables **body horror scenarios**:
- Mad necromancers grafting monstrous limbs
- Corrupt spiritualists harvesting celestial organs
- Assassins seeking multi-armed configurations
- Demonic entities stealing limbs from victims
- Undead minions augmented with extra appendages

**Social Consequences**: Grafted individuals are **taboo** to many:
- **Purists** view them as abominations (exile, purification campaigns)
- **Pragmatists** accept grafting if functional
- **Demented/Chaotic** factions embrace grafting as enhancement

## Content Warning

⚠️ **Mature Themes**: This mechanic involves body horror, non-consensual body modification, necromancy, and anatomical violence. Implementation should include:
- Optional content filters (disable graphic descriptions/visuals)
- Age-appropriate presentation
- Player agency (choice to engage with dark content)

## How It Works

### Basic Rules

1. **Limb/Organ Acquisition**: Obtain limb/organ from donor (harvested, stolen, traded, or consensual donation)
2. **Surgical Procedure**: Graft limb/organ onto recipient via surgery (requires skill, tools, risk of failure)
3. **Property Inheritance**: Recipient gains physical properties of grafted limb/organ
4. **Compatibility**: Some grafts are incompatible (rejection, death, corruption)
5. **Social Reaction**: Factions respond based on outlook/alignment (acceptance, disgust, fear)
6. **Permanence**: Grafts are permanent unless removed (more surgery, risk of death)

### Graftable Components

#### Limbs (External Appendages)

| Limb Type | Origin Example | Properties Inherited | Compatibility Risk |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Arms** | Orc, Human, Elf, Strigoi | Strength, accuracy, reach, regen | Low (common) |

### Grafting Procedures

#### Surgical Requirements

**Prerequisites**:
1. **Surgeon Skill**: Novice grafts (simple limbs), Master grafts (complex organs)
2. **Medical Facility**: Operating theater, sterile environment
3. **Anesthesia**: Patient sedation (or willing to endure pain)
4. **Tools**: Surgical instruments, sutures, anti-rejection drugs (if organic)

**Procedure Steps**:
1. **Harvest**: Remove limb/organ from donor (alive or dead)
2. **Preservation**: Keep graft viable (ice, stasis, necromantic preservation)
3. **Recipient Prep**: Remove existing limb/organ (if applicable)
4. **Attachment**: Surgical grafting (connect nerves, blood vessels, bone)
5. **Recovery**: Patient heals (days to weeks), compatibility monitored

**Success Rate**:
```
Success Rate = Surgeon Skill × Compatibility × Facility Quality × Patient Vitality
```

- **Critical Success**: Graft perfectly integrates, no side effects
- **Success**: Graft works, minor side effects (scars, phantom pain)
- **Partial Failure**: Graft functions poorly, rejection risk, infection
- **Critical Failure**: Patient dies, graft rejects violently, corruption

#### Compatibility & Rejection

**Compatibility Factors**:
- **Species Match**: Same species = high compatibility, different = lower
- **Graft Rarity**: Common limbs (arms, legs) = easier, rare (wings, tails) = harder
- **Recipient Vitality**: Healthy patient = better tolerance, weak = rejection risk
- **Anti-Rejection Drugs**: Improve compatibility (cost resources, side effects)

**Rejection Symptoms**:
- **Minor**: Pain, swelling, limited function
- **Major**: Necrosis, infection, graft dies
- **Catastrophic**: Sepsis, organ failure, death

**Rejection Mitigation**:
- **Immunosuppressants** (organic grafts): Reduce rejection but weaken immune system
- **Necromantic Binding** (dark magic): Force graft to remain viable (corruption cost)
- **Augment Compatibility Tech** (Space4X): Synthetic grafts ignore rejection

### Social Consequences & Faction Reactions

Different factions react to grafted individuals based on outlook and alignment:

#### Godgame: Faction Reactions

| Faction Outlook | Reaction to Grafted | Policy | Reasoning |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| **Traditional** | **Hostile** | Exile, purification | "Unnatural abominations, disrespect ancestors" |
| **Radical** | **Neutral to Positive** | Accept if empowering | "Means to an end, power justifies" |
| **Progressive** | **Mixed** | Debate, case-by-case | "Ethics unclear, depends on consent" |
| **Mystical** | **Negative** | Spiritual contamination | "Souls corrupted, balance violated" |
| **Militaristic** | **Pragmatic** | Accept if combat-effective | "Tools of war, morality irrelevant" |
| **Purist** | **Extremely Hostile** | Hunt and kill | "Existential threat to purity, must purge" |
| **Necromantic** | **Enthusiastic** | Encourage, experiment | "Perfection through grafting, transcendence" |

#### Space4X: Faction Reactions

| Faction Ideology | Reaction | Policy | Reasoning |
|-----------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Naturalist** | **Hostile** | Ban augmentation | "Preservation of baseline humanity" |
| **Transhumanist** | **Positive** | Embrace enhancement | "Evolution through technology" |
| **Collectivist** | **Neutral** | Standardize augments | "Equality through uniform enhancement" |
| **Individualist** | **Positive** | Personal choice | "Body autonomy, self-determination" |
| **Religious** | **Mixed to Hostile** | Depends on doctrine | "Playing god, or divine gift?" |

### Parameters and Variables

| Parameter | Default Value | Range | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| **Surgery Success Rate (Novice)** | 60% | 30-80% | Chance of successful graft |
| **Surgery Success Rate (Master)** | 95% | 80-99% | Master surgeon expertise |
| **Compatibility (Same Species)** | 80% | 50-100% | Rejection chance |
| **Compatibility (Different Species)** | 40% | 10-70% | Higher rejection |
| **Rejection Onset Time** | 7 days | 1-30 days | When rejection symptoms appear |
| **Graft Healing Time** | 14 days | 3-60 days | Time to functional recovery |
| **Social Stigma (Purist)** | -50 reputation | -100 to 0 | Reputation penalty with purists |
| **Property Inheritance** | 80% | 50-100% | % of donor properties gained |

### Edge Cases

- **Multiple Incompatible Grafts**: Grafting wyrm wing + celestial wing = extreme rejection (conflicting energies)
- **Brain Graft Identity Crisis**: Grafting genius brain may overwrite recipient personality (existential horror)
- **Self-Grafting Cascade**: Entity repeatedly grafts limbs, becomes unrecognizable chimera (Ship of Theseus dilemma)
- **Forced Grafting (Non-Consensual)**: Slaves grafted against will (trauma, resistance, ethical horror)
- **Graft Sentience**: Some grafts (demon organs, hive brains) may have residual consciousness (internal conflict)
- **Graft Removal**: Removing graft is high-risk surgery (may kill patient, leave permanent damage)
- **Necromantic Graft on Living**: Living entity grafted with undead limb (necrosis spreading, corruption)

## Player Interaction

### Player Decisions (Godgame)

- **Allow Grafting in Village?**: Ban practice (purist) or permit (pragmatic/demented)
- **Purge Grafted Individuals?**: Exile/kill abominations or tolerate diversity
- **Use Grafting for Military?**: Enhance soldiers with monster limbs (power vs. morality)
- **Divine Intervention**: Bless grafted (acceptance) or curse (rejection)

### Player Decisions (Space4X)

- **Regulate Augmentation?**: Allow unrestricted enhancement or enforce limits
- **Military Grafting Program**: Mandatory augmentation for soldiers (effectiveness vs. autonomy)
- **Alien Organ Trade**: Permit harvesting alien species for grafts (diplomacy impact)
- **Transhumanist Agenda**: Push society toward full augmentation (cultural shift)

### Skill Expression

- **Optimal Graft Selection**: Choosing synergistic grafts (4 elf arms + eagle eyes = sniper assassin)
- **Risk Management**: Balancing power gain vs. rejection risk
- **Social Navigation**: Managing reputation with pro/anti-graft factions
- **Ethical Choices**: Consent vs. power (harvest celestials? Force graft soldiers?)

### Feedback to Player

- **Visual feedback**:
  - Grafted limbs visually distinct (orc arm = bulky/green, elf arm = slender/pale)
  - Wings, tails, extra limbs visible on entity model
  - Scars, sutures at graft sites
  - Corruption visual effects (demon organs = veins glowing, undead = necrotic patches)
- **Numerical feedback**:
  - Property bonuses displayed ("+50% strength [Orc Arm]")
  - Rejection risk percentage
  - Social reputation impact (-50 with Purists)
- **Audio feedback**:
  - Surgery sounds (cutting, stitching, patient groans)
  - Rejection symptoms (coughing, groaning, distress)
  - Faction reactions (cheers from necromancers, gasps of horror from purists)

## Balance and Tuning

### Balance Goals

1. **Power vs. Risk**: Grafts should be powerful but risky (rejection, social cost)
2. **Not Mandatory**: Grafting optional, not required for competitive play
3. **Ethical Weight**: Harvesting sentient beings for grafts should feel morally weighty
4. **Diverse Builds**: Many graft combinations viable (not one dominant "build")

### Tuning Knobs

1. **Success Rate**: Higher success = safer but less dramatic, lower = riskier
2. **Rejection Severity**: How punishing rejection is (death vs. graft loss)
3. **Social Stigma**: How much factions care (extreme ostracization vs. mild disapproval)
4. **Property Magnitude**: How strong graft bonuses are (game-changing vs. minor)
5. **Availability**: How easy to acquire rare grafts (common vs. epic quest)

### Known Issues

- **Power Creep**: If grafts too strong, everyone grafts (becomes mandatory)
- **Ethical Discomfort**: Players may find non-consensual grafting disturbing (needs content warning)
- **Faction Lock-Out**: If purist factions too numerous, grafted players locked out of content
- **Chimera Chaos**: Too many grafts = unrecognizable entities (visual/narrative confusion)

## Integration with Other Systems

### Interacts With

| System/Mechanic | Type of Interaction | Priority |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach

**Grafting System Components**:
```csharp
// Grafted Limb/Organ
public struct GraftedComponent : IComponentData {
    public GraftType Type; // Limb, Organ, Augment
    public Entity OriginalDonor; // Who graft came from (if tracked)
    public FixedString64Bytes DonorSpecies; // Orc, Elf, Wyrm, etc.
    public float CompatibilityScore; // 0.0-1.0
    public bool IsRejecting; // Rejection active?
    public float RejectionProgress; // 0.0-1.0 (0 = stable, 1 = death)
}

// Graft Properties (inherited from donor)
public struct GraftProperties : IBufferElementData {
    public PropertyType Type; // Strength, Accuracy, Regeneration, etc.
    public float Magnitude; // How much property is inherited
}

// Graft Slot (entity anatomy)
public struct GraftSlot {
    public SlotType Slot; // ArmLeft, ArmRight, Wing1, Wing2, Heart, etc.
    public bool IsOccupied;
    public Entity GraftedComponent; // What's in this slot
}

public struct EntityAnatomy : IComponentData {
    public DynamicBuffer<GraftSlot> Slots;
    public int NaturalArmCount; // Base anatomy
    public int NaturalLegCount;
    public bool CanHaveWings;
}

// Surgical Procedure
public struct GraftingSurgery : IComponentData {
    public Entity Surgeon; // Who's performing
    public Entity Patient; // Who's receiving
    public Entity Graft; // What's being grafted
    public SlotType TargetSlot;
    public float SuccessChance;
    public bool InProgress;
}

// Social Stigma Tracker
public struct GraftStigma : IComponentData {
    public int GraftCount; // How many grafts entity has
    public bool HasTabooGraft; // Celestial, demon, etc.
    public float ReputationModifier; // -1.0 to +1.0
}
```

**System Flow**:
1. **GraftAcquisitionSystem**: Handles harvesting limbs/organs from donors (death, surgery, trade)
2. **GraftPreservationSystem**: Tracks graft viability (decay over time, preservation methods)
3. **SurgerySystem**: Executes grafting procedures, rolls success/failure
4. **CompatibilitySystem**: Calculates rejection risk, triggers rejection events
5. **RejectionProgressionSystem**: Advances rejection symptoms (pain → necrosis → death)
6. **PropertyInheritanceSystem**: Applies donor properties to recipient (strength, accuracy, abilities)
7. **SocialReactionSystem**: Updates faction reputation based on grafts
8. **GraftVisualizationSystem**: Updates entity visuals (show grafted limbs, wings, etc.)

### Godgame-Specific: Necromantic Grafting

- **Undead Grafting**: Necromancers can graft onto undead minions without rejection (already dead)
- **Dark Preservation**: Necromantic magic prevents graft decay (corruption cost)
- **Soul Binding**: Force graft soul to remain in body (prevents rejection but enslaves donor)

### Space4X-Specific: Cybernetic Integration

- **Augment Compatibility**: Synthetic grafts ignore organic rejection (designed for integration)
- **Modular Design**: Bionic limbs can be swapped/upgraded easily (no surgery risk)
- **Neural Interface**: Brain implants link augments to nervous system (seamless control)

### Performance Considerations

- **Graft Tracking**: Only track grafts on named/important entities (not all NPCs)
- **Rejection Checks**: Calculate rejection once per day (not every frame)
- **Visual Updates**: Batch visual changes (don't rebuild mesh every graft)
- **Property Caching**: Cache inherited properties, recalculate only on graft change

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests for**:
   - Compatibility calculation (species match, rarity)
   - Success rate (surgeon skill, facility quality)
   - Property inheritance (donor stats → recipient)
   - Rejection progression (time-based degradation)

2. **Playtests should verify**:
   - Grafting feels impactful (visual + mechanical change)
   - Social reactions create meaningful consequences
   - Risk vs. reward balanced (not too safe, not instant death)
   - Ethical weight felt (player considers moral implications)

3. **Balance tests should measure**:
   - Graft power level vs. natural progression
   - Rejection frequency (should be rare but scary)
   - Social stigma impact on gameplay
   - Multi-graft viability (4-armed builds competitive?)

- **Insectoid Limbs**: Multi-arms (4-8), chitinous armor, mandibles
- **Hive Brain Graft**: Psychic link, shared consciousness (identity risk)
- **Crystalline Grafts**: Energy storage, hard but brittle, refractive camouflage

## Ethical Considerations & Content Warnings

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Optional Content**: Allow players to disable graphic descriptions/visuals
2. **Consent Emphasis**: Highlight when grafting is consensual vs. forced
3. **Consequences**: Non-consensual grafting should have severe social/moral consequences
4. **Age Rating**: Mature (17+) due to body horror, anatomical violence
5. **Narrative Framing**: Present grafting as morally complex (not glorified)

### Content Warning Language (In-Game)

> "This content involves body horror, surgical procedures, and non-consensual body modification. Some scenarios include harvesting organs from sentient beings and involuntary grafting. Player discretion advised."
