# Mechanic: Wonder Construction System

## Overview

**Status**: Concept
**Complexity**: Complex
**Category**: Construction / Progression / Economy

**One-line description**: *Multi-stage monument construction requiring professional workers (carpenters, stonemasons, carvers, sculptors) and manufactured resources, built gradually over time with player unable to directly construct.*

## Core Concept

**Wonders** are large-scale, prestigious construction projects that take **months to years** to complete. Unlike normal buildings (player places instantly), wonders require:
- **Professional Workers**: Skilled entities (carpenters, stonemasons, carvers, sculptors)
- **Manufactured Resources**: Processed materials (cut stone, timber beams, bronze statues)
- **Multi-Stage Construction**: Progressive completion (foundation → structure → decoration → finish)
- **Entity Labor**: Player cannot build directly, must rely on entity workforce
- **Long-Term Investment**: Major resource commitment, prestigious reward

Inspired by **Pharaoh's monument system** - player designates site, workers gradually build over time, visible construction progress.

Wonders serve as:
- **Prestige Projects**: Demonstrate faction power, cultural achievement
- **Long-Term Goals**: Multi-year planning, economic management
- **Employment Drivers**: Massive job creation for professionals
- **Cultural Identity**: Monument style reflects faction outlook/alignment

## How It Works

### Basic Rules

1. **Wonder Designation**: Player selects wonder type, places blueprint in world
2. **Resource Stockpiling**: Required resources delivered to construction site
3. **Worker Assignment**: Professional entities assigned to construction
4. **Staged Construction**: Wonder built in phases (foundation, walls, roof, decoration, completion)
5. **Progress Tracking**: Visible construction progress (scaffolding, partial structures)
6. **Completion Bonuses**: Completed wonders grant permanent faction bonuses

### Wonder Types

### Construction Stages

Wonders progress through **5 universal stages**:

| Stage | Description | Workers Needed | Resources Consumed | Progress % |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **1. Foundation** | Laying groundwork | Laborers, stonemasons | Stone, gravel, concrete | 0-20% |
| **2. Structure** | Building main frame | Carpenters, stonemasons | Timber, stone blocks, iron | 20-60% |
| **3. Walls/Roof** | Enclosing structure | Carpenters, roofers | Timber beams, tiles, mortar | 60-80% |
| **4. Decoration** | Artistic embellishment | Carvers, sculptors, painters | Marble, bronze, paint, gold leaf | 80-95% |
| **5. Completion** | Final touches, consecration | All professions | Varies (ceremonial items) | 95-100% |

**Visible Progress**:
- **0-20%**: Foundation visible, scaffolding, ground excavation
- **20-60%**: Walls rising, skeletal structure
- **60-80%**: Building enclosed, roofing visible
- **80-95%**: Decorations appearing (statues, carvings, paintings)
- **95-100%**: Scaffolding removed, wonder fully revealed

### Professional Worker Types

#### Godgame: Traditional Professions

| Profession | Primary Stage | Skills | Training Source |
|-----------|--------------|--------|----------------|

### Resource Requirements

Wonders consume **massive quantities** of resources, driving economic demand.

#### Example: Great Temple (Godgame)

| Stage | Resources Required | Quantity |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Foundation** | Stone, gravel, concrete | 5000 stone, 2000 gravel, 500 concrete |
| **Structure** | Stone blocks, timber, iron | 8000 stone blocks, 3000 timber, 1000 iron |

| **Decoration** | Marble, bronze, gold leaf | 500 marble, 200 bronze, 50 gold leaf |
| **Completion** | Ceremonial items, holy relics | 100 incense, 10 relics |

**Total**: Approximately **20,000+ units of various resources**

#### Example: Orbital Ring (Space4X)

| Stage | Resources Required | Quantity |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| **Foundation** | Exotic alloys, graviton emitters | 50,000 alloy, 1,000 emitters |

| **Control Systems** | Quantum computers, sensor grids | 50 computers, 500 sensors |
| **Completion** | Jump gates, docking systems | 10 gates, 100 docks |

**Total**: Approximately **100,000+ units**

### Construction Workflow

1. **Blueprint Placement**:
   - Player selects wonder type from menu
   - Places blueprint in world (large footprint, designated zone)
   - Blueprint shows final structure (ghosted, semi-transparent)

2. **Resource Delivery**:
   - Construction site has **storage yards** for materials
   - Workers (haulers) deliver resources from stockpiles to site
   - Each stage requires specific resources before progressing

3. **Worker Assignment**:
   - Player assigns professions to construction project (or auto-assign)
   - Workers travel to site, begin work
   - **Work Rate**: Progress per day = (# Workers × Skill Level × Efficiency)

4. **Staged Progression**:
   - Stage completes when progress reaches threshold (e.g., 20% for foundation)
   - Next stage unlocks, requires new resources and professions
   - Workers transition to new tasks

5. **Completion & Consecration**:
   - Final stage (95-100%) involves ceremonial completion
   - Grand celebration (festival event)
   - Wonder activated, bonuses applied

### Player Cannot Build Directly

**Critical Design**: Player **cannot speed-build** wonders like normal buildings.
- No instant construction
- No "miracle" to complete instantly (or extremely expensive miracle, rare)
- Must rely on entity workforce
- Economic planning required (resource chains, worker training)

**Player Agency**:
- **Designate** wonder site
- **Prioritize** resource allocation (rush deliveries or slow build)
- **Assign** workers (pull from other jobs or train new specialists)
- **Pause/Resume** construction (if resources scarce, can halt progress)

### Parameters and Variables

| Parameter | Default Value | Range | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| **Construction Time (Small Wonder)** | 1-2 years | 6 months - 5 years | Time to complete small wonder |
| **Construction Time (Large Wonder)** | 5-10 years | 2-20 years | Time to complete massive wonder |
| **Worker Efficiency (Novice)** | 0.5x | 0.3x-1.0x | Slow, learning on job |
| **Worker Efficiency (Master)** | 2.0x | 1.5x-3.0x | Fast, experienced |
| **Resource Stockpile Cap** | 10,000 units | 5,000-50,000 | Max storage at construction site |
| **Workers per Stage** | 20-50 | 10-200 | How many workers needed |
| **Prestige Bonus** | Varies by wonder | 10-500 | Permanent faction prestige |

### Edge Cases

- **Resource Shortage**: Construction halts if resources unavailable (progress frozen)
- **Worker Death**: If workers die (plague, war), progress slows or stops (must recruit replacements)
- **Sabotage**: Enemies can raid construction site, destroy progress (set back stages)
- **Wonder Abandonment**: Player abandons wonder mid-construction (partial structure remains, resources lost)
- **Wonder Destruction**: Completed wonder can be destroyed (siege, disaster) - devastating loss
- **Multiple Wonders**: Can multiple wonders be built simultaneously? (yes, but splits workforce/resources)

## Player Interaction

### Player Decisions

- **Which Wonder to Build?**: Choose based on faction needs (military monument vs. grand library)
- **Timing**: Start wonder during prosperity or wait until economy stabilizes?
- **Resource Allocation**: Divert resources to wonder or maintain normal economy?
- **Worker Training**: Train specialists (sculptors, carvers) or hire from other factions?
- **Prioritization**: Rush wonder (pull workers from other jobs) or slow build (sustainable)?

### Skill Expression

- **Economic Planning**: Balancing resource chains to sustain long-term construction
- **Workforce Management**: Training pipeline for specialized professions
- **Timing**: Starting wonders during golden ages, avoiding crises
- **Defense**: Protecting construction sites from raids, sabotage
- **Multi-Wonder Juggling**: Managing multiple wonders without economic collapse

### Feedback to Player

- **Visual feedback**:
  - Construction progress visible (scaffolding, rising walls, statues appearing)
  - Workers actively building (animations: hammering, carving, hauling)
  - Resource stockpiles at site (piles of stone, timber stacks)
  - Stage transitions marked by visual milestones (roof completion, statue unveiling)
- **Numerical feedback**:
  - Progress bar (0-100%, stage markers at 20%, 60%, 80%, 95%)
  - Resource requirements (current vs. needed for next stage)
  - Worker count (assigned, working, idle)
  - Estimated time to completion (based on current rate)
- **Audio feedback**:
  - Construction sounds (hammering, chiseling, sawing)
  - Stage completion fanfares (celebration when stage finishes)
  - Grand consecration ceremony (music, cheering) at 100%

## Balance and Tuning

### Balance Goals

1. **Long-Term Investment**: Wonders should feel epic, not trivial
2. **Economic Impact**: Building wonder should stress economy (meaningful choice)
3. **Reward Justifies Cost**: Completion bonuses should feel worth the investment
4. **Not Mandatory**: Wonders optional, but desirable (prestige, power)

### Tuning Knobs

1. **Construction Time**: Longer = more epic but potentially frustrating
2. **Resource Cost**: Higher cost = greater economic challenge
3. **Worker Efficiency**: Skill scaling (masters vs. novices)
4. **Stage Thresholds**: How evenly stages divide (equal 20% increments or variable?)
5. **Completion Bonuses**: How powerful wonder bonuses are

### Known Issues

- **Waiting Simulator**: If construction too slow, becomes boring (need engaging mechanics during build)
- **Resource Grind**: If resources too scarce, wonder becomes tedious resource hunt
- **Worker Bottleneck**: If professionals too rare, wonder stalls indefinitely
- **Sabotage Frustration**: If enemies easily destroy progress, players give up
- **Economic Collapse**: If wonder costs too high, bankrupts faction (game-over spiral)

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Approach

**Wonder Construction Components**:
```csharp
// Wonder Blueprint (placed in world)
public struct Wonder : IComponentData {
    public WonderType Type; // GreatTemple, Colossus, OrbitalRing, etc.
    public float3 Position; // World position
    public float ConstructionProgress; // 0.0-1.0
    public ConstructionStage CurrentStage;
}

// Construction Stage Definition
public enum ConstructionStage {
    Foundation,    // 0-20%
    Structure,     // 20-60%
    WallsRoof,     // 60-80%
    Decoration,    // 80-95%
    Completion     // 95-100%
}

// Resource Stockpile at Site
public struct ConstructionSite : IComponentData {
    public Entity WonderEntity;
    public DynamicBuffer<ResourceStack> Stockpile; // Delivered resources
    public DynamicBuffer<ResourceRequirement> NeededResources; // Per stage
}

// Construction Worker
public struct ConstructionWorker : IComponentData {
    public Entity AssignedWonder;
    public Profession Profession; // Stonemason, Carpenter, Carver, etc.
    public float SkillLevel; // 0.0-1.0
    public float WorkEfficiency; // Modified by morale, tools, etc.
}

// Wonder Completion Bonus
public struct WonderBonus : IComponentData {
    public BonusType Type; // Prestige, FaithGeneration, Recruitment, etc.
    public float Magnitude;
    public bool IsActive; // Only active when wonder complete
}
```

**System Flow**:
1. **WonderPlacementSystem**: Handles blueprint placement, footprint validation
2. **ResourceDeliverySystem**: Routes haulers to deliver resources to construction site
3. **WorkerAssignmentSystem**: Assigns professions to wonder based on current stage
4. **ConstructionProgressSystem**: Calculates progress per day (workers × skill × efficiency)
5. **StageTra nsitionSystem**: Detects stage completion, unlocks next stage, updates visuals
6. **CompletionCeremonySystem**: Triggers celebration event, activates wonder bonuses
7. **WonderVisualizationSystem**: Updates mesh/visuals to reflect construction progress

### Godgame-Specific: Wonder Aesthetics

Different faction outlooks build distinct wonder styles:
- **Traditional**: Classical architecture (marble columns, symmetry)
- **Radical**: Bold, asymmetric designs (statement pieces)
- **Mystical**: Ethereal, otherworldly structures (floating elements, glowing runes)
- **Militaristic**: Fortified, imposing monuments (battlements, weapon motifs)

### Space4X-Specific: Megastructure Scale

Space wonders operate on stellar scale:
- **Orbital Ring**: Visible from planet surface, massive structure encircling world
- **Dyson Swarm**: Thousands of solar collectors, dim star slightly
- **Gateway Nexus**: Hub of glowing jump gates, constant ship traffic

### Performance Considerations

- **Mesh LOD**: Wonders use LOD system (distant view = low poly, close = high detail)
- **Staged Loading**: Load detailed meshes only when stage completes (avoid memory bloat)
- **Worker Pathfinding**: Cache paths to construction site (reuse for multiple workers)
- **Progress Caching**: Recalculate progress once per day, not every frame

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit tests for**:
   - Progress calculation (workers × skill × efficiency)
   - Resource requirement validation (per stage)
   - Stage transition triggers (20%, 60%, 80%, 95%)
   - Completion bonus activation

2. **Playtests should verify**:
   - Construction visually engaging (progress noticeable)
   - Resource management challenging but achievable
   - Worker assignment intuitive
   - Completion feels epic and rewarding

3. **Balance tests should measure**:
   - Average construction time vs. expectation
   - Resource cost vs. faction economy (should be significant but not bankrupting)
   - Worker efficiency scaling (novice vs. master impact)
   - Completion bonus value vs. investment
