2025-10-27 04:11:15.328 +02:00 [INF] [Mode: StepByStep] User prompt: 1. Create a new scene (e.g., Assets/Scenes/MiningLoopDemo.unity) with:                                                                                                                           
      - One carrier prefab set up via SpawnerAuthoring + PlaceholderCarrierArchetypeCatalog/PlaceholderCarrierProcessing configs.                                                                  
      - Three mining vessel prefabs (direct latch, beam-with-drones, drone hub variants) spawned through SpawnerAuthoring using the spawner config folder.                                         
      - An asteroid field (using PlaceholderAsteroidField and chunk catalog configs) positioned within the carrier’s operating range.                                                              
  2. Ensure every spawned vessel has required components/buffers (MiningStance, MiningLatchConfig, MiningDockingState, MiningTransferAdapter, MiningCargoHold, etc.) so Agents A/B systems run.    
  3. Hook up simple debug/UX aids—e.g., gizmos or minimal HUD—to visualize assignments, latch status, and docking queues during the demo.                                                          
  4. Confirm the scene references relevant config assets (doctrine, chunk catalog, spawner configs) and add notes in Docs/EnvironmentSetup.md or a README stub under Assets/Scenes/ describing how 
     to run the demo.
