This document defines how every gameplay / validation scene in **PureDOTS** must be structured. Keep it handy whenever you create or edit a scene so we remain deterministic and aligned with TruthSource rules.

---

## 1. Naming & Location

| Scene Type           | Location                                           | Naming Pattern                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Gameplay / Prototype | `Assets/Scenes/<Feature>/<FeatureScene>.unity`     | `<FeatureScene>.unity`                         |
| Validation / QA      | `Assets/Scenes/Validation/<Scenario>.unity`        | `ScenarioName.unity`                           |
| SubScenes            | `Assets/Scenes/Validation/SubScenes/<Scene>.unity` | `<ParentScene>.SubScene.unity`                 |
| Shared Prefabs       | `Assets/Scenes/Validation/Prefabs/`                | Domain-specific                                |

Always keep the SubScene asset in the same folder tree as the parent scene to avoid GUID conflicts.

---

## 2. Root Hierarchy Template

Every scene begins with:

```
SceneName (root)  <-- plain GameObject
 ├─ BootstrapConfig      (MonoBehaviour layer)
 ├─ SandboxHUD / UI      (Canvas + debug readers)
 ├─ TimelineOverlay      (Rewind overlay)
 ├─ SimulationSubScene   (SubScene with DOTS entities)
 └─ Optional helpers     (Lighting, cameras, ground, etc.)
```

### 2.1 BootstrapConfig
- Add **PureDotsConfigAuthoring** (drag the script if it does not show up in the add-component menu).
- Assign `Assets/PureDOTS/Config/PureDotsRuntimeConfig.asset`.
- This seeds `TimeState`, `HistorySettings`, resource catalogs, and any other runtime singletons. Even if the SubScene contains the same data, the config is the canonical source.

### 2.2 Simulation SubScene
1. Select the GameObjects you want converted to entities (villagers, resources, storehouses, etc.).
2. Run **GameObject → Convert To Entity → Convert and Save As SubScene** and save as `Assets/Scenes/.../<Parent>.SubScene.unity`.
3. Confirm the SubScene appears in green and has a valid `.entities` cache (no warnings in Console).
4. Keep SubScene authoring GameObjects lean—only DOTS authoring components (`*Authoring`, `Baker`, `ConvertToEntity`) and Transform/Gizmos helpers belong there.

Recommended placements (world space metres):

| Object     | Position (x,z) | Authoring                                                     |
|------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Villager   | `(-4,0)`       | Villager prefab (`Assets/PureDOTS/Prefabs/Villagers/...`) or authoring equivalent. |
| Resource   | `(0,0)`        | `ResourceSourceAuthoring` with valid `resourceTypeId`.        |
| Storehouse | `(6,0)`        | `StorehouseAuthoring` with capacity entries.                  |

Add **Entity** conversion (`Convert and Destroy`) if the prefab/authoring object does not already include it.

### 2.3 HUD & Overlay
- Add a Canvas (`Screen Space - Overlay`) named `SandboxHUD`.
  - Attach `DebugDisplayReader` and wire time/rewind/resource text fields if desired.
- Add a root-level GameObject `TimelineOverlay` with `RewindTimelineDebug`.
  - Keep the default window position (20, 20) and size unless the scene requires adjustments.
- Ensure an `EventSystem` exists for UI.

### 2.4 Lighting, Camera, Ground
- Use the default `Main Camera` targeted at the action (e.g. position `(0, 5, -12)`, look at `(0,0,0)`).
- A simple plane/cube can act as the ground (optional but helps orientation).
- Reuse template lighting settings unless the feature requires custom lights/shadows.

## 3. Required Components & Scripts

| Component / Script                  | Purpose                                         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| PureDotsConfigAuthoring             | Seeds runtime singletons & catalogs.            |
| ResourceSourceAuthoring             | Converts authored resource nodes to entities.   |
| StorehouseAuthoring                 | Defines storehouse capacities & queues.         |
| VillagerAuthoring / Prefab          | Adds villager data & conversion pipeline.       |
| DebugDisplayReader                  | HUD for time/registry data.                     |
| RewindTimelineDebug                 | Displays current record/playback/catch-up state.|
| Optional: OverrideAutomaticNetcodeBootstrap | Disable NetCode bootstrap when using our custom world. |

**Important:** The `PureDOTS.Authoring` asmdef must NOT be editor-only; otherwise MonoBehaviours cannot be attached. Verify `Assets/Scripts/PureDOTS/Authoring/PureDOTS.Authoring.asmdef` has an empty “Include Platforms” list.

---

## 4. Rewind Sandbox Minimum Checklist

Before committing a new/updated validation scene:

1. Scene loads without Console errors or “entity header” warnings.
2. SubScene assets (`*.SubScene.unity` and `*.entities`) exist and reimport cleanly.
3. Holding the rewind input switches overlay mode to Playback → CatchUp → Record.
4. Villager job loop, resource registry, and storehouse registry all reset deterministically when rewound.
5. `Docs/QA/SinglePlayerRewind.md` smoke test passes (use the checklist there).

---

## 5. QA & Automation Notes

- For every new validation scene, file an entry in `Docs/QA/` describing its purpose and the manual test flow.
- Consider adding PlayMode tests that use the same setup to keep behaviour deterministic across refactors.
- Keep scenes small: prefer one feature per validation scene to isolate issues.

---

By following this template we ensure every scene matches project expectations, stays deterministic, and remains ready for automated testing. Update this document whenever the process changes.***
